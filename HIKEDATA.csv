We want to start branching out and exploring more hiking trails but I dont want to set up something we aren't ready for.

47,Hiking/Camping suggestions for Spruce Knob/Seneca Rocks in WV," 

Hey folks!

My girlfriend and I are going to be in Huntington, WV next Friday for a concert and we're looking to do some hiking/camping in WV that Saturday/Sunday. I've been looking around and so far Spruce Knob or Seneca Rocks have caught my eye. The only downside is that those destinations are roughly a 3 - 4 hour drive and we need to drive back to Pittsburgh that Sunday.

Here are some links I've found for backpacking around Spruce knob, but I feel like these hikes will be pushing it with our time frame. Are there any moderate day hikes toward dispersed camping sites (no car camping) around the spruce knob/seneca creek trails? Maybe starting at the spruce knob peak and hiking towards Gandy creek campsites or the Johnny meadows? I'm open to any tips or suggestions..Just looking for a good day hike and camping in West Virginia.

Fortunately, there was some brush to grab onto, or I would have fallen down a pretty steep slope into boulders. When the owner finally noticed what was happening, he called out ""she's friendly!"", but his verbal commands to control the dog were ineffective.

I understand that I may have been partly to blame for the interaction: I didn't engage an obviously friendly dog -- I didn't want to. Maybe she took my backing away and avoidant body language as an invitation to play, I don't know. I was tired from a long uphill slog and I didn't want to have to deal with it, so I stepped aside to allow her to pass. That's the point where she jumped on me and nipped, and I fell. 

My request: Dog owners, please be heads-up. It shouldn't be the responsibility of other hikers on the trail to figure out how to interact with your dog. Assuming otherwise is irresponsible, selfish and potentially dangerous. ",hiking,1535661331,roncotron,14,1,True,2018-08-30

3,Choosing a new headlamp: Petzl Actik Core vs Petzl Tikka,"I just lost my Petzl Tikka+ and I am looking for a new one or an upgrade. 

I'm looking for something that has red light and can endure lots of hours on AAA batteries. 

The Actik lamp is a hybrid version allowing use of AAA batteries or Petzl proprietary battery, which is ok. The price is almost similar to the Tikka. Actik also brings more lumens, if needed. I've sometimes used the turbo mode on the Tikka, but most of the time I'm going on med/low setting. Also, if I'm getting this correctly Actik has 2 different LEDs - 1 for close lighting with more of a flood and 1 for far away lighting with more of a throw.

The thing that is bugging me is the operation hours mentioned in their specification. Petzl say [Actik](https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/ACTIVE-headlamps/ACTIK-CORE) goes for 7 hours on ""standard"" 100 lum setting. Which if they don't have a typo in the specs, is very low, I don't want to eat batteries for breakfast. 

[Tikka](https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/CLASSIC-headlamps/TIKKA) on the other hand offers 60 hours of lightning time on the same standard 100 lum setting, which is more believable. I swapped batteries once per many months in my old headlamp.

What is the real endurance of the Actik and do you have any other general recommendations?

​

Sadly, while I love the feel of the Merrells around my clompers, I'd find that after a few hours of walking on flat sidewalks, my feet/legs would feel incredibly heavy and clunky, like I'd strapped a pair of anvils to my feet. I'm constantly surprised (and saddened) at how heavy the Merrells feel after a little use. They fit beautifully AROUND my feet, they just seem so weirdly heavy.

50,Softshells and Softshell Jackets,"*All comments are welcome!* 

# Introduction

The classic layered clothing system is very useful most of the time, especially for cold protection. Hiking clothing must be well-designed, flexible, and functional - it should not restrict the body movements necessary for high intensive pursuits. Generally, it consists of a moisture-wicking base layer, warm mid layer, and wind- and waterproof outer layer. The mid layer provides most of the insulation. It comprises one or several garments of thicker material (often fleece), though the choice of textiles is more or less arbitrary as long as a good insulation is provided.

For many years waterproof breathable garments were promoted as being the only shells needed, able to protect from both wind and rain. Although true, even the best waterproof fabrics are far less breathable than those that are windproof but not waterproof. Additionally, waterproof breathable fabrics aren’t very durable because the membranes are very thin (and getting even thinner).

Nowadays, it’s recognized that waterproof breathable garments aren’t suitable for all conditions and actually clothing that’s water-repellent, windproof, and highly breathable is more versatile and more comfortable. This new clothing was called *softshell* and rain gear was called *hardshell*.

The softshell bridges the gap between mid and outer layers - we called it the “fourth layer” in our post about hiking clothing layering. Softshell jackets are designed to maximize both water resistance and breathability. Composed of two- or four-way stretch-woven fabrics, these garments are flexible, so they tend to fit and to drape better. Compared to hardshells, softshells are much more breathable, but also less water- and wind-resistant. Moreover, softshell jackets are well suited for any conditions except for the most extreme weather.

# Softshell as part of a hiking clothing layering

The ideal shell is uninsulated, windproof, completely waterproof, and completely breathable. As usual, what’s ideal doesn’t exist in life. However, there are various strategies that come close to the aforementioned ideal. One strategy is to have a single, multifunctional, waterproof breathable shell. Given that this shell is breathable enough, it may be the best way to go. Another strategy used by many backpackers relies on two shell layers: a light, windproof, and breathable layer of wind gear and a light rain jacket. This allows the wind gear to be worn in cool, windy, and even lightly drizzling conditions, whereas the more expensive shell is worn in the heavy rain. This two-shell strategy can be cheaper, and the wind gear allows much better ventilation. But a nonbreathing layer (if used) will be more uncomfortable than a waterproof breathable rain jacket, and bringing two shell layers means additional weight.

Each layer has its own specific function in the classic layered clothing system. Base layers worn next to the skin are designed to wick away humidity to the outer layers, to stay dry and to offer thermal protection in cold weather. Mid layers focus on thermal insulation and to draw moisture away from the skin to the outer layer. Outer layers protect from the rain, snow, and wind. Combined, these three layers are designed to work together to offer overall comfort and protection. The classic layered clothing system is well adapted to outdoor activities such as hiking or backpacking where breathability have become the main performance feature. Nowadays, the focus shifts to the mid layer which is replacing the outer layer as the most important clothing layer.

Softshells situate between mid and outer layers. They are more breathable than an outer layer (classic rain jacket), provide better wind protection and are water-repellent (to a degree), unlike fleeces. Softshell jackets usually provide warmth, flexibility, and wind resistance. 

Softshells are designed for intense activities like backcountry skiing and combine ease of movement, wind protection, and water repellency. They’re also lighter than classic insulation jackets, are easily stored into a backpack and pull on when conditions get rough. Softshell jackets generally resist water penetration for 20-30 minutes - time enough to find shelter or to put on a rain jacket. A softshell jacket designed for lightweight and compact protection is easy to store in a backpack and pull on when conditions get rough.

Following the trends in the last several years, it’s quite easy to identify that the outdoor market is moving to a four-layer system in very cold and extreme conditions. Then, the wearer will combine four garments: base layer, fleece, softshell and an insulation jacket for maximum warmth and protection.

On the table below, you see the evolution stages of hiking clothing layering from classic three-part system to the new clothing system, which includes softshell.

# Softshell materials

The shift of emphasis from waterproofness to breathability first became an issue in waterproof breathable membranes when membrane manufacturers shifted the focus of their research and development on improving the breathability of their products. The arrival of solid hydrophilic, as opposed to microporous hydrophobic, membranes and coatings, made it possible to bypass the complex matter of trying to balance the porous nature of a microporous membrane with its necessary waterproofness.

Softshells jackets are made of synthetic materials (such as nylon and polyester) with an open weave that allows body heat and built-up moisture from inner layers to escape but is still tightly woven enough to repel light wind and rain. Many of these fabrics are made from microfibers - soft, supple, strong, and very comfortable. Microfibers are also windproof and water resistant since air spaces are fewer and smaller than in other fabrics. Once you apply a coating to a fabric, however, you reduce the breathability even if it still isn’t fully waterproof.

# Characteristics of softshells

Softshell jackets serve as mid layer and outer layer together and are more breathable with moderate wind resistance. Moreover, they could also protect from light showers and most snowfall.

Manufacturers have developed durable composite stretch textiles to offer a new series of functions: breathability, thermal insulation, ease of movement, and, depending on the face fabric, abrasion and/or water resistance.

The high air permeability makes fleeces highly breathable, however, it also makes them prone to strong winds. Thus, fleece manufacturers have sought to reduce the air permeability of their products to make them better suited to outdoor activities by bonding the fleece to a woven face or to a wind-blocking membrane.

**Pros**

* *Breathability* \- a softshell outperforms a hardshell, especially in high-exertion activities like climbing or backcountry skiing.
* *Warmth* \- thanks to the fleece lining, a softshell jacket traps enough air and provides insulation to make you feel warm and cozy.
* *Wind resistance* \- in comparison to fleeces, most softshells can handle wind gusts fine. Some softshell jackets are actually windproof and can protect you from the wind very well.
* *Flexibility* \- the shift from protection to ease of movement has introduced a new leaner and cleaner silhouette made to enhance thermal insulation and to reduce bulk to improve ease of movement and comfort. This new approach has influenced hardshell jacket design too – the new generation of hardshells promotes the leaner, fitted look typical for softshell jackets.
* *Water resistance* \- most softshells are either water resistant or water-repellent and will keep you dry in light rain.

**Cons**

* *Not waterproof* \- softshell jackets are not waterproof as they are not made with waterproof breathable membrane and do not have taped seams to stop water entering in at the stitched areas. Anyway, waterproofness is rarely necessary, though it can be crucial on long hikes and/or when hiking in wet areas/regions.
* *Have less airflow than a fleece* \- both the woven face and the wind-blocking membrane reduce the air flow passing through the fleece fabric making the softshell less breathable than an ordinary/regular fleece.
* *Dry more slowly than a fleece* \- the additional coating slows down the drying time of a softshell.
* *Heavier* \- softshell are relatively heavy and not as packable as thin fleeces. As a result, they dry fairly slow which makes softshell jackets unsuitable for long trips where you might need to dry your clothes overnight.
* *Expensive* \- this is one of the most typical characteristics of softshell jackets and probably the number one disadvantage most backpackers point out when asked about softshells’ pros and cons.

# Softshell jacket design

The technology associated with the design, cutting, and manufacture of performance clothing such as a softshell is highly complex. Typical functional details include arm lift, articulated elbow and knee constructions. Additionally, sophisticated hoods concealed in collars, intricate closures and many other features relevant to movement and body protection are developed through experience and experimentation. Specialist studies are carried out by the military and by commercial concerns, but this data is not readily accessible in the public domain so the development of garment blocks for performance sportswear has been through trial and error or from adaptations of existing garments.

The usual requirement for an outer shell is to be lightweight and packable for easy storage, especially for summer hiking. Additional features include but are not limited to adequate map-sized chest pockets, zip guards, slim fit, drawstring waistband with cord lock, Velcro adjustable cuffs, adjustable hood, high stand-up collar and temperature regulating zip vent under arms for ventilation.

**Hood**

The hood, in particular, is important as it can be pulled up to provide warmth and ward off the wind or light showers without needing to break stride. However, not all softshell jackets come with a hood. If the sole purpose of your softshell will be to act as a mid layer underneath a waterproof breathable jacket, a softshell without a hood may be a better option. However, if you intend to wear your softshell jacket as an outer layer, an adjustable hood is a useful feature. It will help you stay warm and dry in light rain and/or in windy conditions.

**Internal and external pockets**

Most softshell jackets have plenty of pockets and the majority of them come with a zippered closure to securely store your personal belongings. For example, pockets are useful for fitting small items such as maps, gloves, money etc. Some softshell jackets will have pockets on the back of the jacket. These are particularly handy for storing small items such as your lighting in case that you decide to give night hiking a shot.

**Underarm vents**

Zip vent under arm provides enough airflow for better ventilation as it lets perspiration out as well as lets air in to help dry the skin. This way, you can easily adjust the airflow to carry away some of the moisture.

**Inner fabrics**

Many softshell jackets have fleece linings for better thermal insulation and warmth. For more info about fleece and its features, you can read our blog post dedicated to fleece and fleece jackets.

**Stretchy fabric**

Softshells are great for active pursuits due to the stretchy fabric which is comfortable and does not restrict movement. Especially useful are elastic-bound sleeve cuffs as they won’t let cold air in.

# Day hiking vs multi-day hiking

Softshell jackets are meant to protect you from wind, rain, and cold ""most of the time"". It means that this concept is pretty good for city wear and also for day hikes. But when going on multi-day hikes, you need something that will give you full protection from the cold, heavy rain and wind. Unfortunately, softshells offer this just for the first half an hour. A second strike against softshell jackets for long trips is their weight, which makes them suitable for both city walks and for day hiking but not for layering and long hikes. As they are close-fitting to trap warm air efficiently, the cut doesn't suit for a warm coat underneath. Moreover, they aren’t waterproof.

The human body must be kept within a narrow temperature range, outside of which well-being suffers. Exclusion of rain or water is especially important because water can conduct away body heat much faster than air can. On multi-day hikes, you need to stay as dry as possible because often you don’t have an easy access to shelter. In this case, an effective layered clothing system with a good rain jacket is going to be much more effective because using separate layers has several advantages over softshells. Firstly, they provide fuller protection and more flexibility. Secondly, they’re more compact than a softshell. And finally, they can be lighter.

# Conclusion

Comfort in all its forms is important especially on the trail where, in certain cases, it can be vital for survival. Hiking clothing should be as lightweight as possible in addition to not restricting body movements. Hiking clothing should exclude wind and especially rain as well. It should be hard wearing, easily maintained, and quick drying. Fabric construction, aesthetics, design, functionality, and fitting are all extremely important for a quality, comfortable and high-performance garment. Nevertheless, keep in mind that fabric performance can be lost by frequent washing.

Nowadays, we can add a fourth layer to the classic layered clothing system - the so-called softshell designed for multifunctionality and high-intensity activity. Made from synthetics such as polyester and nylon, it’s flexible, insulates well from the wind, protects from light rain, and “breathes” reasonably well. These characteristics make the softshell jacket an ideal outer layer for city walks as well as day hiking. However, its disadvantages make it unsuitable for multi-day trips. I such cases, you need constant and better protection from the elements - a waterproof breathable outer layer, which will help you stay dry even in a heavy rain.

65,Doing The Lost Coast Trail - My First West Coast &amp; First Multi-day Hike,"In a little less than a month, I'm doing the Mattole to Black Sands Beach stretch of the Lost Coast Trail. I'm pretty excited and have most of what I'm pretty sure I need (normal hiking gear, tide info, bear canister, etc.), but I had a few questions that I'm hoping to get some insight to:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Weather - I've never hiked next to the ocean before and wondering what I can expect mid September in northern California. I want to make sure I bring the proper gear (clothing especially) and don't end up cold, wet, or both. Also read some notes about the wind, wondering how intense that can be.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Shoes - I've read about how the hike is a lot of large rounded rocks and sand. What I'm trying to determine is hiking shoes or hiking boots. The shoes are definitely better for agility and if that's what this trail needs, shoes seem to make sense. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) Bugs - I'm from Missouri so I'm used to mosquitos, chiggers, and ticks. Wondering how these critters fair out West.

&amp;#x200B;

4) Water - I've read that there are a lot of fresh water sources on this trail, but I'm new to purification. Wondering what would suffice that isn't going to cost me an arm and a leg. 

&amp;#x200B;

5) Is the poison oak as bad/thick as some people make it seem?

&amp;#x200B;

Any other suggestions/tips/tricks/warnings regarding the trail would be more than welcome! This trail has been on the top of my list for a while and I'm so excited to finally be doing it!

My issue is that by buying a hiking bag and buying a camera case to put inside I won't have quick access to my camera.

I'm a landscape photographer and would like to be able to access my camera without taking my backpack off. I go on 1-4 day hikes usually.

I was split between the MindShift Horizon 180 and the Vanguard Alta Sky 45D. I bought the 45D on amazon and upon receiving it I discovered it's not quite big enough for me.

- Will we need hiking boots, or are hiking shoes sufficient?

67,Quick question for all you lady hikers out there.,"I am currently in the development stage of a hiking legging for women (and potentially men?) and would love some feedback from the community of wonderful women who are hear on /r/hiking

First and foremost, do you even wear leggings while hiking/camping/backpacking/being outdoors? 

If so, is there anything you would love to see added to your current leggings that would make it easier to carry things?  Maybe extra pockets or a way to convert to shorts when the sun gets hot?  How about a Dry Pocket to avoid wet phones or other valuables getting soaked when hit with rain or crossing a stream? 

My wife and I hike all the time and she has had a heck of time finding a legging she enjoys.  Often times, the fitness legging just doesn't cut and she isn't a pant wearer.

We definitely have our own opinions on what we would like to see added, but our world is small and we haven't been able to get much feedback from other people.

Hopefully this isn't breaking any posting rules. I won't post anything about our business, nor ask for anything other than your opinion on gear accessories.

Would love to hear everyone's thoughts and potentially start a discussion about improving the hiking community with a new pant!

I was just wondering about the definition. I know about the paradox about measuring coastlines, but I guess for the most part ""walking the coast"" just means walking along the path that follows the coastline most closely.

But, what happens when you come to a river estuary? 

Would you just pick the lowest crossing? What if that crossing was at the mouth of a large tidal estuary/delta, with paths up and down each of the tidal channels?

If you crossed at the mouth of those estuaries, you'd be missing long stretches of path that is technically on the coastline. If you *did* walk up each estuary mouth, where would you cross each of them? (e.g. at the lowest/highest tidal point on the river, or somewhere else?)

Monday- Gonna do the east rim, scheduled a drop off for the east entrance. Overnight camp somewhere near the junctions I'm guessing we has a permit if it's needed here.

Thursday- Get back to camp and chill.

Friday- We are gonna do the lottery for Subway, if we don't we may overnight LA Verkin, checkout the kolab arch. Although we were also thinking of day hiking that, coming back early for an early leave Saturday.

Saturday- Return from La Verkin, and leave for home. Or, if we did day ytios Friday, leave early Saturday for the grand Canyon north rim, 2 and a half hours south. Adds to our trip time back north to Oregon, but none of us have seen the Grand Canyon.

49,Fleece And Fleece Jackets,"*All comments and recommendations are welcome.* 

## Introduction

Fleece is a durable and versatile man-made fabric - an important part of the contemporary hiking clothing industry.

A fleece top can be used during cool days as an outer layer - fleece jackets are warm and comfortable but breathable at the same time. Fleece jackets are often windproof and water resistant or water-repellent, which is not typical for most regular fleece tops. On cold days, a fleece can be used as a mid layer under a waterproof breathable insulation jacket, for example. Mid layers are used to trap still air next to the skin and provide insulation and fleeces do exactly that. They provide warmth and thermal insulation and keep you comfortable in cold and wet conditions given that you have a good rain jacket to keep you dry from the outside.

Regardless of its use, fleece has huge benefits over other fabrics and the rest of this text is intended for showing some of them. But let’s start from the beginning.

# Brief history

*Fleece* (sometimes called *pile*) was first used in clothing by the Norwegian company Helly Hansen. In 1961, Helly Hansen together with Norwegian Fiber Pile Inc. created the first fleece called Fiberpile. The Swedish lumberjacks were among the first people who found out that it offered great thermal insulation in wet and cold conditions.

In the United States, Malden Mills (nowadays called Polartec) made a smoother version called Polar fleece in 1979. Actually, Polartec accepts 1981 as the birth year of the polar synthetic fleece made by engineering polyester fibers into a new knit construction. Then Patagonia developed a pile called Synchilla (comes from synthetic chinchilla) with Malden Mills. It was softer, double-faced fabric that did not pill. This, with the developments of Pontetorto’s Tecnopile (or Technopile) in Italy - they began producing pile fleece fabrics in 1985 - represented the emergence of the polyester fleece technology prevalent today.

# Materials

Fleece fabric is a synthetic fabric often made of a plastic such as polyester, polyolefin or polypropylene. Anyway, in most cases, fleece is manufactured from polyester. Some of the most important properties (for manufacturing hiking clothing) of polyester fibers include the following:

* Polyester fibers are hydrophobic making them water-repellent, moisture-wicking, and quick-
* Polyester fibers are very durable and resistant to stretching.
* Polyester fibers do not shrink.
* Polyester fibers are wrinkle and abrasion-resistant.
* Polyester fibers are resistant to chemicals and easy to care for.
* Polyester fibers are lightweight and cheap to produce.

In addition, the polyester fabrics can be given hydrophilic coating making them moisture-wicking - crucial for easy transportation of moisture from the skin to the outer surface and from there to the environment.

Because of all these properties, polyester has been used in various sportswear applications since the 70s. Generally, synthetic fibers have been widely preferred for activewear due to the multitude of performance enhancements they offer compared to natural fibers. Textile fibers contribute toward moisture control, thermal regula­tion and breathability, cooling effects, softness, stretch and UV protection.

Fleece fabric is manufactured from polyester, which is spun into yarn. This yarn is then knitted into a fabric with tons of tiny loops. The loops are then sheared, or napped causing the fabric to puff up and become thicker forming a soft-handle pile. Finally, the pile is shaved down to an even length. The resulting fabric is lightweight, breathable, durable, quick-drying, and easy to care for (typical properties of the polyester). Additionally, fleece remains warm when wet (typical for sheep’s fleece and wool, in general) and does not absorb moisture. Moreover, it is so good at insulation that it has an insulation capacity similar to that of wool, however, at roughly half the weight. The fabric may also be treated with a durable water repellent (DWR) thus making the fleece rainproof, though you can’t rely on it to replace a regular waterproof rain jacket in a heavy and/or continuous rain.

Fleece is manufactured in a variety of weights and finishes, offering different amounts of loft and insulation and numerous layering possibilities. For instance, Polartec grades its classic Polartec fleece fabrics as 100, 200, and 300 weight. The higher the number, the heavier and warmer the fleece, as Polartec 100 is equivalent to 9.5 oz per linear yard, Polartec 200 is equivalent to 12.5 oz per linear yard, and Polartec 300 is equivalent to 16 oz per linear yard. Other manufacturers label their fleece tops “lightweight”, “midweight”, “heavyweight” or by the fabric weight in grams per square meter (usually 100g/m2, 200g/m2, 300g/m2).

Sustainable alternatives include fleece garments made from recycled polyester and PET plastic bottles. For example, Unifi Manufacturing Inc. produces REPREVE recycled polyester fiber from plastic bottles. Patagonia was the first outdoor clothing manufacturer to use recycled fleece, back in 1993. 

# Characteristics of fleece

**Pros**

* Warm - fleece is warm because of its structure. Air is trapped between the fibers in the pile, creating excellent thermal insulation even in wet and cold conditions.
* Remains warm even when wet - worn over a wicking inner layer and under a waterproof breathable jacket, fleece can keep you warm in just about any weather while you are on the move and is particularly effective in wet, cold weather. Fleece moves moisture quickly and warms you fast enough even in very cold conditions.
* Highly breathable - and what’s more - fleece can be inherently water-repellent (when it’s made of a hydrophobic material such as polyester) so it continues to be breathable even when wet making it an ideal material for wet and cold conditions.
* Moisture-wicking and quick-drying - it’s hydrophobic meaning that it repels and does not retain/absorb water. Additionally, fleece fabric allows hydrophilic treatment done to modify its surface and to increase the fleece’s surface energy. This is what enhances the surface’s wettability and adhesion meaning that the fabric can distribute moisture evenly on its surface for faster and more efficient transportation.
* Durable - fleece is a very sturdy fiber because it’s made of polyester, which is made from a recycled PET. And we all have seen how durable plastic bottles are.
* Cheap - one of the most important competitive advantages of polyester in comparison with the natural fibers is its low cost. This is one of the reasons for the ever-growing use of polyester and why nowadays it is the most used fabric in the clothing industry. Since fleece is made of polyester, it’s also much cheaper than wool, for example. Additionally, it’s environment-friendly - there aren’t many other widely-used materials made out of recycled PET bottles.
* Light - fleece is a lightweight material, which makes it a good alternative to wool for outdoor activities such as hiking, backpacking or mountaineering.
* Provides soft, non-itch feel - fleece was meant to imitate wool but without some of wool’s cons such as its difficulty in washing or itchy feeling. Thus wearing fleece on the trail shouldn't cause any skin problems.
* Easy to work with - despite the fact that it's thick, fleece is actually easier to use than many other fabrics.
* Doesn’t shrink - quality fleece made from 100% polyester is not supposed to shrink unless you wash and/or dry it at a very high temperature.

**Cons**

* Not windproof - fleece has poor wind resistance - you can easily blow through it meaning that you need an additional wind resistant layer over it even in a cool breeze. There is windproof fleece clothing, but it’s heavier, bulkier, and less breathable than ordinary fleece.
* Doesn’t compress well - hiking clothing made of/with fleece takes up more room in the pack.
* Repels cleaning products (because of its water-repellency) which can lead to a buildup of bacteria and odors.
* Pollutes the environment - microplastics from fabrics such as fleece are released in to wastewater systems during fabric finishing and normal laundering processes. They are dispersed over long distances by wind and ocean currents, where they accumulate in the environment and work their way into the food chain.

# Fleece as part of a hiking clothing layering

A fleece top can serve two purposes in a layered clothing system:

* An outer layer for cool conditions - fleece jacket, fleece hoodie and other types of fleece tops; and
* A mid layer, worn between a base layer top and an insulation jacket, to increase warmth and buffer moisture in cold-and-wet conditions. This is the primary role of a fleece in a layered clothing system.

Polyester fleece is used as an outer layer in crisp temperatures. Fleece jackets are usually windproof and water-repellent and though these characteristics make them warmer and suitable for an outer layer in cool weather, they reduce breathability, slow dry times, and are not as fast at wicking moisture in comparison to standard fleece. They are very warm but not very versatile since you can’t separate the layers. Hoods can be useful in cold weather but they aren’t typical for most fleece tops.

To make fleece windproof you have to add a windproof layer - usually thin nylon, polyester shell, lining or a membrane. Any of these makes fleece garments bulkier and heavier than standard fleece. It’s far warmer than regular fleece and will also keep out showers, though not heavy rain. “Heavyweight” fleece is useful for such applications, though you may feel it too warm while hiking. Anyway, fleece jackets are soft and comfortable, and many people wear them in camp or as everyday use. The lighter types can also be used as a convenient outer layer, especially during summer hiking trips.

In wet and cold conditions, fleece is a perfect mid layer, worn between a base layer top and an insulation jacket (or light rain shell) meant to protect you from the elements. In such a case, fleece is used primarily because of its thermal insulation ability.

A fleece top intended to be used as a mid layer should be simple. Avoid features that add weight, absorb water, reduce breathability, slow dry times, and add cost. Stick to “lightweight” and “midweight” fleece tops for this application. Generally, which one you should choose depends mainly on your preferences.

The lightweight fleece (sometimes called also microfleece) is lighter, thinner, more breathable, functional and versatile than the other two types of fleece tops. This is actually the original mid layer used between a moisture-wicking base layer top and a waterproof breathable insulation jacket. During cold weather hiking, you can wear two of these instead of a heavier fleece. In milder weather, one will be enough to provide you enough warmth. This type of fleece is meant to be light, so don’t expect to find additional features like a hood or multiple pockets. Most manufacturers of fleece tops have thin microfleece garments in their range, and there are plenty of choices.

The midweight fleece is used as a mid layer for cold weather hiking. It’s also pretty convenient for camp use, especially in wet and cold conditions. Midweight fleece tops offer better thermal insulation than lightweight fleeces and can be used as an everyday outer layer in cool weather. However, this type of fleece offers less flexibility. There are many midweight fleece tops on the market so you have plenty of choices.

Fleece tops should be fairly close-fitting to trap warm air efficiently. They are prone to the *bellows effect* *(Body movements result in a bellows effect which pumps the microenvironment air around and through clothing layers. Increased external air movement also increases air exchange, even if clothing* *is constructed from relatively air-impermeable fabric. This exchange can decrease clothing thermal insulation and water vapor resistance, which influences the heat balance of the wearer.)* so the hem should be elasticized, have an inner elastic cord and cord locks, or be designed to tuck into your pants. Elasticated cuffs offer a customized fit and protection from the cold. A high collar with chin guard helps keep your neck warm and stops warm air from escaping. Full or half zip helps for better temperature regulation as you can easily let in fresh air to ventilate your body if needed or even take off the fleece is it becomes too hot.

# Fleece jacket design

Fleece jackets usually have a stand-up collar with full-zipped entry and set in, or raglan sleeves. A basic model often includes two hand pockets; however, design details on more expensive fleece jackets include chest or sleeve pockets and offset seams for comfort. Folded elastic binding is often used on the cuff, hem, and hood edges. Seams are constructed using stretch stitches such as four-thread overlock (mock safety stitch) and top and bottom cover seam, or flatlock where a low profile is required. An example of a typical fleece jacket design is shown in the figure below.

[Typical Fleece Jacket Design](https://i.redd.it/7zg0x4y7eog11.jpg)

The fabric is lightweight and densely woven for better wind resistance. The fleece jacket is often treated with a DWR for better water resistance. Detailing is minimal, usually comprising side-entry pockets and a hood. At lower price points the cuffs, hem, and hood are bound with folded elastic; however, increasingly complex adjustment systems allowing one-handed operation are introduced as garments become more expensive. Application of discontinuous baffles may provide comparatively more flexibility. Abrasion-reinforcement of certain parts supports thermoregulation in specific body areas such as shoulders, chest, and forearms.

# Other applications

Fleece’s warmth (and low price) has increased its popularity for indoor use - it has become the base fabric for a variety of blankets. It’s also used for pants (especially as a lining material), sweatshirts, hoodies, headwear, mittens, scarves, pajamas, baby diapers, and in many other applications.

# Conclusion

Fleece is a synthetic material manufactured primarily from polyester, though some fleeces are made from other man-made fabrics and even merino wool. For many years now fleece is the standard fabric for warm garments. Fleece offers very good thermal insulation even when wet, moves moisture quickly, and is light, sturdy, almost nonabsorbent, quick-drying, and relatively cheap. These properties make fleece fabric ideal material for the outdoor clothing industry.

There are basically three types of fleece tops depending on the thickness of the fabric, as manufacturers label their fleeces “lightweight”, “midweight”, “heavyweight” or by the fabric weight in grams per square meter. For example, Polartec, one of the pioneers in fleece manufacturing, label them Polartec 100, 200, and 300 (from lightest and thinnest to heaviest and thickest respectively).

Fleece can be used either as a mid layer between a base layer top and an insulation jacket or as an outer layer. Lightweight and midweight fleece tops are more appropriate as a second layer. Simple, streamlined models are best for such applications because they’re lighter, more functional and versatile. Heavyweight fleeces are used mainly as outer layers. As such, fleece jackets are usually windproof and are often treated with a DWR for additional water resistance. There's a wide range of fleece jackets on the market. The higher the price, the more additional features they usually have, which doesn't always corresponds to increased functionality.",hiking,1534521478,Camotrek,1,1,True,2018-08-17

I'm just learning to navigate, and one of the tips is to fold the map so only shows the immidiate area of interst. Problem is, I cant find any decent tutorials online of how to do this. Most videos are pretty much how to fold a topo map that comes unfolded.

I can work out how to fold the map if the area of interst happens to be on a concetena section, but am stuggling when the location crosses a fold. Simply flipping over the fold/map is one solution I guess, but doesnt seem like taking a bearing on the map would be possible if point A and B are on different sides of the map! I can't work out how to keep the map ""flat"" if I don't fold along the premade folds.

Latest attempts have pretty much ruined the origional prefolds, so its now more of a self-raising map-ball!

Am I missing something or is there a secret art behind map folding?!?

I know next to nothing about fishing so feel free to educate me if you do: wouldn't you just need a fish hook and some fishing line and that's it, then just try your luck on a river or lake?

The downsides feel really minimal: if it's too hot you often won't walk in the middle of the day anyway or even if you can walk from 6am to 6pm taking 2 hours to try to get fresh food seems nice no? This this almost no weight added to your pack.

The upsides are looking awesome: \*\*bonus\*\* (I won't rely on catching fish to eat) fresh food instead of dehydrated stuff &amp; standard hiking food. Fishing is relaxing, for the body and the mind.

54,Basic Foot And Hiking Shoe Care,"*All comments and recommendations are welcome.* 

# Introduction

Sooner or later most hikers realize the need to maintain healthy feet regardless of the cost. The majority prefers to administer self-aid to their individual foot problems and only if the problems turn out to be unmanageable and painful, a podiatrist is sought out.

One of the basics of proper foot care is to wash both feet daily. For example, pouring cold water over them provides relief on hot summer days. It’s important to give your feet free air time. You can remove your footwear and socks several times during the day to let your feet cool down and air.

Shoes play an important role in getting the maximum efficiency from your body’s movements. Maximum foot efficiency depends most importantly on correctly fitting the right hiking shoe. Hiking shoes should protect the feet from abrasion and minimize the incidence of injury. They should adequately support the feet, ankles, and legs and be flexible and shock absorbent enough to allow excellent performance. Selecting the right hiking shoe will ensure that your foot is properly supported and balanced. Comfort and cushioning are also important considerations, especially through long periods of training or performance or when unusual stresses occur as when hiking at an altitude, for example.

Shoe care and maintenance is an important part of the whole hiking experience. Proper shoe care can not only extend the life of your trekking shoes but can also make sure that you feel more comfortable on the trail.

# Foot care

**Basic foot care**

There’re some basic rules for maintaining your feet in good condition that you can apply before you hit the trail, during your hikes, and after long hiking days:

* Wash your hiking socks daily (without using soap) to wash away grit, skin particles, and sweat.
* Let your feet dry and air out at least once a day.
* A clean, dry, and warm pair of socks at night helps your feet recover overnight.

Unfortunately, there is no technique to keep your feet dry in prolonged wet conditions (waterproof hiking shoes and waterproof socks won’t help you). Instead, focus your efforts on minimizing the effects of wet feet:

* Your feet need to be well hydrated. You can apply a moisturizer to your feet at night after they have dried out. To be efficient, it needs enough time to absorb well into the skin.
* Wear thin hiking socks and lightweight shoes. They dry much faster than waterproof footwear or backpacking boots.
* Test your hiking shoes in advance, especially before long multi-day hikes.

Keeping your feet in good condition is one of the best things you can do to ensure a pain-free hiking for yourself and for your feet. When possible, dry wet feet to avoid softening the skin too much.

**Hot foot and foot odor**

Hot foot and foot odor can be helped by using breathable hiking shoes with antibacterial insoles. It’s also advisable to wear hiking socks made of good quality, moisture-wicking, natural fibers like merino wool. Hiking normally requires a thin inner layer and a thick outer layer. For best fit, when choosing hiking shoes, wear the hiking socks you will be using on the trail.

Two conditions may affect the skin of the foot. The condition of producing excessive perspiration is called *hyperhidrosis*, while *anhidrosis* is called the inability to produce and/or deliver sweat to the surface of the skin. A backpacker should change socks once or twice a day, especially when hiking in hot weather. The use of a foot powder usually helps to keep the excessive sweating under control, while the use of moisturizing creams for skin hydration is the best treatment for dry skin.

The best treatment for foul-smelling sweat on the foot (the so-called *bromhidrosis*) is the daily use of an antibacterial soap. Sweat itself is odorless but promotes bacterial growth, and the resultant odor is a product of the bacterial decomposition of surface protein debris.

**Nail care**

Toenails should be cut short and square because long nails can bruise, cut into the toes on either side and inflict pain during descents. Moreover, if toenails are properly cut, problems at the corners of the nails will be markedly reduced.

There are two other problems that can befall your toenails on the trail: black nails (*subungual hematoma*), and fungus of the nails (*onychomucosis*). If bleeding and pain occur under the nail, see a podiatrist. The podiatrist will drill a hole under the nail plate and the blood will escape through this hole. This process is painless so you don’t have to worry about it. Fungal infection of the toenails is usually the result of an invasion of a fungus into a nail. The best prevention is to control the length and thickness of your toenails.

**Blisters**

Prevention of blisters begins with identifying rubbing surfaces. Properly-fitted gear and footwear that is broken-in is the first step in prevention. Additionally, identifying hot spots and treating these will prevent the pain associated with a blister. Smooth out all wrinkles in your hiking socks before you put your shoes on, change your hiking socks as often as possible, and do not reuse socks a second time without washing them. All these will also help prevent blisters.

Once formed, blisters can be very painful and difficult to heal. Removing the fluid inside a blister will minimize the pain. Sterilizing a needle in the backcountry is best done by flaming the needle and allowing it to cool. Then create pinholes at the lowest point on the blister close to the margin with normal skin, allowing drainage by gravity. It may be necessary to drain the blister several times over the first day after blister formation. Antiseptic wipes or piece of toilet tissue can be used to absorb the fluid and wipe the area dry. Maintaining the integrity of the outer skin flap will reduce pain and promote healing. Eventually, the outer skin flap will dry.

What is common to all blister remedies is that the blister must be covered to prevent infection and cushioned against further rubbing. The key points to any blister dressing are to provide adequate padding and to keep the blister clean, dry, and free of debris. You can cover a blister with ordinary adhesive tape, moleskin, micropore tape, or even duct tape. Friction causes blisters, so try to find and remove the cause, though it may not be obvious. In such a case, you just have to hope that covering the blister will solve the problem.

# Hiking shoe care

Hiking shoes are subjected to two types of wear, abrasion (wear and tear) and “aging”. Aging of shoes is mainly a result of chemical processes and can be appreciably delayed if the trekking shoes are made with materials that have a built-in resistance to corrosive bacterial erosion. The primary causes of chemical breakdown are friction, humidity, bacterial erosion, perspiration, and heat.

**How to clean hiking shoes**

*Leather* hiking shoes must be kept dust-free because when small grains of dust are allowed to accumulate on leather shoes, they cut into the leather with every step you take. You can wipe the dust off your leather trekking shoes with a dry or damp rag. If you want to use and moisturizing soap, you need to apply the soap to the outside of the shoe. If mud dries on the uppers, they can harden and crack. A soft brush helps remove mud, though be careful not to scratch the leather. If you want to remove stains, there are specific cleaning products for this. You can clean the insides of boots using a clean, damp cloth. Be careful when cleaning waterproof hiking shoes or boots since the membrane is very thin and fragile.

*Suede* leather should be treated with a dry brush or sponge. Don’t bring suede into contact with water because this can cause cracks and make the material stiff.

*Nubuck* leather is soft leather, which is more absorbent than some other leathers and should dry without cracking or stiffening.

*Nylon* (and *poromeric*) materials are best cleaned with a damp cloth or soft brush since treatment with creams, polishes or silicone solutions will block the pores of the fabric and reduce its breathability.

*Canvas* (including *mesh*) can be washed; however, careful hand washing with a mild soap and a soft brush is better than putting the shoes in a washing machine. Generally, canvas can be machine-washed, however, the main problem is that some of the other materials in the hiking shoe may be affected. Wash the shoelaces separately in soap and water (you can use bleach as well). If you hang your shoes outside to dry, hang them for an eyelet. When the hiking shoe is new or newly cleaned, spraying the canvas with spray starch will prevent dirt from getting into the fabric of the canvas.

**How to condition and polish leather shoes**

Over time leather shoes lose some of the natural oils that make them soft and pliable (especially if stored in warm, dry climates). Choose a conditioner that is specific to the type of leather used to make your shoes. However, you don’t need to use a leather shoe conditioner if you use a conditioning soap, or regularly apply a paste or cream polish to your hiking shoes. These products already function as conditioners.

There are four basic forms of shoe polish: cream, paste, wax, and liquid. Cream and paste polishes soak into the leather, resulting in a color that lasts. They also can act as conditioners. Wax polish offers extra protection for your shoes so use it if your shoes are regularly exposed to rain, mud, etc. Additionally, wax polish offers a first-class shine. The biggest disadvantage of using wax polish is that it may dry out leather. Use liquid polish if you want a polish that will dry quickly.

**How to dry hiking shoes**

The way you dry your shoes is important. The best way to dry hiking shoes is to allow them to air dry. Stuffing a newspaper inside the shoes will also help them dry by drawing the moisture out. Just don’t forget to replace the newspaper when it gets wet.

Drying footwear can be a problem on long hikes when it is tempting to dry sodden boots by a fire. Try not to do that. Excessive heat is very likely to make leather harden and split and may melt the glues that hold footwear together. Wet footwear should never be dried in a hot place such as next to a car heater, a house radiator, or a campfire. Shoes should be left in a cool, dry place to dry slowly, with the insoles removed and the tongues fully open.

When wet footwear has dried, it needs to be treated to restore suppleness and water repellency. All shoes can be treated, including waterproof hiking shoes. It is important that the water repellency of the outer is maintained because if it fails and the outer soaks up moisture, breathability will be impaired. Remove the laces and open the tongue fully so you don’t miss any areas. Make sure that you don’t forget to treat the base of the tongue since it is a key leak point.

The most important thing to remember is that drying takes time and you shouldn’t force it.

**How to waterproof hiking shoes**

To be truly waterproof a boot must have a membrane sandwiched inside the materials. Waterproof hiking shoes leak rarely, though some people argue that it happens quite often. What’s really happening is that the boot’s original DWR (durable water repellent) has worn off, so the upper materials get saturated. The feeling of “wet foot” comes from this.

Keep your boots well conditioned and regularly treat them with a waterproofer, and your feet will feel and stay dry. Depending on how hard you use your hiking shoes, you may want to waterproof them more often or not so often. For regular hikers, this could be up to a couple times a season.

Proper waterproofing treatment increases water repellency and prolongs life by keeping leather footwear supple. It also depends in part on the type of leather. Basically, you have two choices:

* **Use a wax or oil**  
Use wax or oil if your shoes are worn primarily outdoors (e.g., hiking boots), or if the shoe is made of a mixed material such as nylon and leather (don’t apply waterproofing oils and waxes to suede or nubuck as they will damage the quality of the leather). You need to clean the shoes first. Then apply the wax or oil with a cloth or brush. Be sure to work the product into the shoes’ creases. Allow the shoes to stand overnight. Waxes work best when applied to warm, dry leather in the evening before wearing the shoes so that there’s enough time for the wax to soak in. There is a trade-off between the amount of wax you apply, the degree of water resistance obtained, and the breathability of your Several layers of wax will mean better and longer-lasting water resistance but less breathability. Thus, don’t use too much wax for your summer hikes.
* **Use a waterproofing spray**  
Use a waterproofing spray if your shoes are made of a more delicate leather, or if your climate is only mild to moderately wet. Clean the shoes and then spray evenly from 20-30 cm. Allow the shoes to stand overnight. Water-based treatments can be applied to wet leather. They don’t block the spaces between the fibers, so footwear remains breathable. And because they can flex, they don’t wear off quickly. Water-based products have other advantages. They’re environmentally friendly, non-flammable and don’t give off noxious fumes, so they are safe to use indoors.

Both methods have their advantages as a waterproofing spray is easier to apply. Some waterproofing oils, such as mink oil, actually condition leather shoes.

**Caring for the soles of your shoes**

There are different materials that are used in the construction of the soles of hiking shoes. While hiking, many of these materials are subjected to water, mud, and abrasive surfaces such as rock, gravel, and turf. Most soles are best cleaned with a stiff, dry brush or under a water tap and dried immediately with a dry cloth. Oils and chemicals should not be brought into contact with soling materials - they can lead to the deterioration of the shoes.

# Conclusion

You need to care for your feet because your hiking trips depend on them being in good condition. Wash them regularly and let them air out at least once a day; keep them dry and well hydrated; wash your hiking socks daily and always start the day with a clean pair of hiking socks. Use breathable hiking shoes (or waterproof hiking shoes depending on the conditions) with antibacterial insoles for odor resistance and wear hiking socks made of good quality, moisture-wicking fibers. Identify hot spots and treat them to prevent the formation of a blister and always cut your toenails short and square to prevent bruise and cuts into the toes on either side.

The full spectrum of caring for your hiking shoes includes cleaning, conditioning, polishing, drying, waterproofing, and storing. Proper maintenance of your trekking shoes can extend their life and more importantly, can ensure more comfort for you and for your feet on the trail.",hiking,1534165850,Camotrek,0,1,True,2018-08-13

37,The Secrets Of Good Hiking Socks,"*All comments and recommendations are welcome.* 

# Introduction

Hiking socks may seem like a generic item, but they are not - their materials, thickness, and construction greatly affect their performance.

Designed to provide significant functional and protective benefits for the active person, hiking socks are an essential component of footwear for an experienced hiker or backpacker.

# Materials

Most hiking socks are made from synthetics (mainly polyester), merino wool or blends of wool and various synthetics such as nylon for improved durability or spandex for improved fit.

**Wool**

Wool is a standard material for socks. Being a natural fiber, it is hydrophilic but has some other positive characteristics of benefit for hiking socks (or other sports socks). Generally, wool socks cushion your feet, keep them warm in winter and cool in summer, wick away sweat, and retain warmth when wet. Feet can give off a great deal of moisture. All of this liquid cannot escape through your footwear. Wool socks will absorb some moisture until it can pass through your footwear or go out at the ankles. Wool is a good insulator and also keeps its shape when damp which reduces the danger of your wool socks causing blisters. One of the typical characteristics of wool is that it feels warm when wet - wool can absorb up to 30 percent of its own weight in moisture and still feel dry and warm. It is also odor resistant. Wool is relatively durable but isn’t very abrasion-resistant, however, so nylon is often added as reinforcement at the heel and toe.

Specialized wool yarns known as Merino wool have been developed that have many of the characteristics of synthetic fibers. Compared with traditional wool, Merino wool has longer, softer, and finer fibers than other wool, making it more comfortable, giving a softer feel and more airspace for moisture movement. Additionally, Merino wool ensures no-itch, while regular wool socks and apparel have tendencies for skin itch. Merino can also retain its shape longer than other wool.

**Synthetics**

Synthetic fibers have been engineered to have some important physical properties for athletic performance: water resistance, wicking, thermal insulation, wind resistance, anti-microbial resistance, durability, maintenance of shape when wet, quick drying, reduced weight, cushion and resiliency, reduced coefficient of friction, and odor resistance.

The most popular synthetic fibers used for sports socks are acrylic and polyester. Synthetic socks, made from acrylic, polyester (COOLMAX, Hollofil, Dacron, Thermolite), polypropylene, and nylon are supposed to wick moisture faster than wool and dry more quickly. Acrylic and polyester have several advantages over cotton fibers: they're hydrophobic, have superior wicking properties, and dry faster. In contrast to wool, synthetics feel damp when only a small amount of moisture is present. While both acrylic and polyester remain soft with multiple machine washings, resist wrinkles and stains, and retain their shape with moisture exposure, COOLMAX and other polyester fibers have a 15% faster drying time compared to acrylic fibers.

For summer hiking and/or in hot weather, polyester hiking socks (COOLMAX) are a better option than acrylic socks because, generally, acrylic provides poor insulation and, on hot surfaces, acrylic fiber socks can conduct heat. Additionally, some synthetics have been developed specially for cold conditions. Good examples of this are Thermolite and Hollofil. Designed to trap air, in a way similar to the way wool does it, they provide better insulation for your feet.

**Cotton**

Avoid cotton in sports socks; it soaks up the sweat and then feels cold and clammy and takes a long time to dry. When wet it loses its shape and easily wrinkles, which is uncomfortable and can cause blisters.

Whatever the material, sweat-soaked socks should be changed for dry ones or your feet will be more likely to blister. Especially in hot weather, you need to change your hiking socks once or twice a day.

# Hiking sock design and construction

A *crew* *length* sock is a standard hiking sock used all-year-round by many backpackers. The upper of the crew sock ends just below the calf muscle. The *mini-crew* design ends just above the malleoli of the ankle and is a popular choice primarily for summer hiking.

Densely knitted socks cushion better and feel more comfortable against the skin. In general, more expensive socks use more fabric and tightly woven knit patterns in their construction to provide maximum protection for the foot.

Ribbed legs with alternating thin and thick sections and elastic fibers in the leg or at the top of the sock keep the legs from sagging and slipping down. Good hiking socks are shaped at the heel (have a standard heel gore) for a good fit with no loose fabric as Y-Gore provides the best fit and conformity for the heel. Tube socks do not provide adequate fit since they have loose material around the heel that can slip and bunch up under your foot.

Some sports socks have different densities of material at different points for more cushioning or warmth. For instance, the foot of the sock can have a cushioned sole portion and cushioned instep portion. The arch section may have additional elastic for support. Some socks have an elasticized section over the instep, which helps with the fit.

The toe area of the sock has a seam that should be flat and smooth; it may be almost imperceptible in finer quality hosiery. The so-called seamless socks may benefit your feet by reducing pressure over the toes.

For cold weather, terry loops on the inside, especially underfoot, are warmer and more comfortable than flat knits. For warm weather, a flat knit over the foot and rib knit on the legs is cooler.

Whatever type of hiking socks you choose, make sure they fit well. Sock sizes often cover three or four shoe sizes, so you’ll need to check the chart on the package to find the size that should fit. Keep in mind that most socks tend to stretch over time, so if you hesitate between two variants, the smaller size is usually the better choice.

When putting on hiking socks, make sure the heel pocket is in the right place and that there’s no loose fabric anywhere. If there is, the socks don’t fit properly. Socks need to fit your footwear as well as your feet. Thus, for best results, you’d better wear your hiking socks when you fit your footwear.

# Functions and benefits

One of the primary differentiating features of hiking socks, compared to casual socks, is the utilization of high-tech fibers and yarns. Today, the ordinary cotton sweat socks have been replaced with sports socks composed of synthetic fibers designed to provide better comfort and protection for the feet.

The conventional three-season backpacking sock system consists of two pairs. A thin liner sock is worn next to the skin. Its primary purpose is to manage moisture. Between the liner sock and the shoe, a thicker outer sock is worn to provide cushioning and insulation. However, wearing only a liner sock has some advantages too: they dry faster; absorb less moisture, and are cooler in three-season conditions.

**Waterproof Socks**

Wet feet should not be a problem when wearing hiking shoes or boots for short periods. Lightweight hiking shoes and boots without waterproof breathable linings dry quickly when the air is dry. However, in prolonged wet weather, your footwear can stay wet for days. As a result, the skin of your feet gets softer, which can lead to blisters and sore spots. Waterproof hiking shoes and boots are suitable for cold conditions; however, in warm weather, these can be very hot and sweaty.

Waterproof breathable socks are much better than waterproof boots because they give more protection than boots. The reason is that waterproof hiking socks are much higher, some reaching just below the knee. In cold and wet conditions waterproof socks can work well, though the comfort range is too limited. When wet, they are slow-drying and not very durable.

**Moisture Management**

In general, cotton fibers and most wool fibers are considered hydrophilic, while synthetic fibers are hydrophobic. Moisture can accumulate in the shoe from three different sources: the foot itself, the legs and trunk of the hiker, and the outside environment.

The production of moisture from the sweat glands of the feet during vigorous physical activity is estimated to be in the range of 2-2.5 liters per twenty-four hours. The production of moisture from the remainder of the body during exercise can exceed one liter per hour. Therefore, in order to keep moisture content at a minimal level on the surface of the foot during exercise, a sock must wick moisture (meaning transport moisture away to the shoe upper for evaporation).

Cotton fibers are hydrophilic and can absorb three times as much moisture as synthetic fibers. Moreover, cotton socks retain moisture and their drying time is much longer compared to synthetic socks. In a sedentary activity, cotton socks may be preferable to synthetic socks, given the low moisture output of the feet, and the better absorptive capacity of these hydrophilic fibers. However, during hiking or another physical activity, the absorptive capacity of any sock will be exceeded, and then you need moisture-wicking socks. They allow movement of moisture from the foot surface to the shoe for evaporation to the outside environment. When wet, acrylic fibers swell 5%, wool fibers swell 35%, cotton fibers swell 45%. Generally, swelling of fibers limits moisture transport and is related to a loss of shape and conformability to the foot.

**Clinical benefits of sports socks**

Being the closest layer of protection against the foot, socks have the potential to protect the skin and the deeper tissues from injury.

In walking and running, the primary stresses on the feet are impact, plantar pressure, friction, and shear. Impact forces result from gravity and inertia as the body propels forward. Plantar pressures are the result of impact, bone deformity, and biomechanical issues. Friction and shear occur when the foot strikes the ground tangential to the supportive surface and when the foot pushes off in propulsion. When external movement exceeds the frictional force at the skin interface, shear occurs where layers of skin begin to move upon each other. Initially, shear forces cause exfoliation of the stratum corneum on the skin surface but continued shearing forces can cause a cleft to develop, resulting in a blister.

Modern specialized sports socks can significantly reduce impact shock and plantar pressures on the foot. In addition, modern socks might mitigate shearing forces which result in friction blisters.

Friction blisters are considered the most common skin injury in sport. Because the sequel of these blisters can result in infection and disability, blister prevention has been of keen interest particularly in the United States Military.

Studies show that the establishment of a movement interface between the layers of a sock system will prevent skin injury as double-layer synthetic sock systems have been shown to be more effective than single-layer synthetic fiber socks in the prevention of blisters. The use of a polyester (COOLMAX) liner combined with a heavily padded wool/polypropylene-blended outer sock works out best for reducing the formation of blisters. Additionally, the fiber composition of the sock (it seems that synthetic fibers work best) may reduce the friction force on the skin surface.

Studies show that certain sports socks appear to be able to reduce moisture content on the feet during activity. This will minimize the chance of friction blisters. Damaging skin shear will also be minimized when thicker padded socks are worn, or when a two-layer synthetic sock system is worn. Other skin injuries such as calluses, corns, and toenail trauma may also be minimized by the wearing of proper sports socks.

# Conclusion

When choosing socks for backpacking, keep in mind that specialized hiking socks may change the fitting requirements of the shoe. Heavily padded socks may require the addition of a full shoe size to allow proper room for the foot. The feet should be measured when you’re wearing the hiking socks intended to be worn during your hiking trip.

Good fit is difficult when socks are offered in sizes covering a broad range (greater than three shoe sizes) and that’s why premium sports socks are usually offered in narrow size ranges. Remember that sock sizes are not the same as shoe sizes.

In the case of chronic blisters, a double-layer or padded sock system is recommended. If there is no significant concern about skin injury, the selection of fiber may be more important than the construction style.

The socks marketplace is filled with products with consumer benefit claims such as blister protection, anti-microbial protection, and insulation which have not been scientifically substantiated. However, based on the best available scientific evidence, remember that:

* Cotton fibers are not recommended for construction and use in sports socks because of poor performance when exposed to moisture.
* Synthetic fibers have several advantages over cotton: they’re better at wicking moisture and also dry faster; they’re more durable and can maintain their shape when wet.
* Wool fiber socks, particularly Merino socks, have many positive characteristics of synthetic fibers. Wool hiking socks are superior to cotton socks in cold environments and have adequate wicking capacity to keep the feet drying.
* Padded socks are preferred to thin, un-padded socks because padding can protect the skin surface from friction and shear and can also significantly reduce plantar pressures and impact shock thus reducing the risk of feet injury.
* The use of a synthetic fiber liner sock, establishing a double-layer sock system, better reduce the incidence of blisters compared to single-layer sock systems.

Finally, when looking for hiking socks, keep in mind that good hiking socks cushion feet, reduce abrasion from your footwear, wick away moisture, and keep feet at the right temperature. ",hiking,1533994719,Camotrek,7,1,True,2018-08-11

50,2-Day Hiking Plan at Banff!,"I'm in Calgary for work this late August and my co-worker and I decided to stay for the weekend to hike in Banff. I drafted a plan and was wondering if I could get some input from you guys please! I selected these trails based on some recommended trails blogs and images posted by hikers. Also any thoughts on doing which day first? I.e. my thought process was to do the more touristy trails on day 2. If you also think I should do some other trails instead, please let me know! I was also kind of interested in doing Healy Pass instead of Mount Bourgeau. Thanks in advance guys!

# DAY 1 (or 2)

1. **Trail to Mount Bourgeau: Bourgeau Lake, Harvey Lake, Harvey Pass, and Mount Bourgeau summit** (8-10 hour).
2. **Tunnel Mountain at Banff** (1-2 hour). Not sure if we'll have enough energy after Mount Bourgeau, but I added this here in case we're down. Was also debating between doing this early morning or after dinner. Any input?

# DAY 2 (or 1)

1. **Lake Louise (1 hour).** We want to stop by there because of how iconic and beautiful (?) this spot is, but really not a fan of super touristy spots.
2. **Rockpile Trail to Moraine Lake (2 hour).** Apparently less touristy?
3. **Sentinel Pass and Larch Valley Hike (4-6 hour).** Sounds like it's basically impossible to find parking at the Moraine Lake parking lot if you get there after 6 am.

56,Question on trail runners for the type of hiking that I do.,"I know it is common for people to make posts asking about the differences between trail runners, hiking shoes and hiking boots. I know all of the differences between them, and I am in need of a new pair of hiking footwear. I am really interested in trail runners at the moment as the idea of having something more lightweight and maneuverable is appealing (currently always use heavy waterproof boots).

&amp;nbsp;

I am planning on trying on different trail runners (looking at the Lone Peak 4.0s), but I do not know if they would be suitable for the type of hiking I do. I don't do any thru hikes or really multi-day trips at the moment. Most of my hiking is done in the White Mountains in NH, Mt. Washington obviously being the biggest mountain I go up, and the Franconia Ridge Loop being the longest. There are set trails of course, but it is not super long distance or endurance. There are a lot of rocks uphill root filled sections, etc. It is what I consider just general ""hiking"". 

&amp;nbsp;

I have always owned mid hiking boots that are heavy, sometimes leather, and always waterproof. Do you think this type of hiking would be fine in trail runners? Or would something like hiking shoes (ie: Salomon X Ultra 3 low, non gtx) that have a little more beef be better? I know trail runners are more common for hikes like the PCT and AT, and I would go on smaller hikes to get used to the feeling before taking on Mt Washington and longer hikes.

Just wanted to hear some thoughts on whether or not trail runners would be a great choice to go with this style of shoe, given the type of hiking I mainly do.",hiking,1533501525,DNNYVST,3,1,True,2018-08-05

108,[Advice needed] How to deal with dog poop on a hike,"So I started taking my dog hiking this last week, and we're both loving it.  I ran into a problem yesterday though and I'm hoping y'all can give me some feedback on how I can deal with it.

Like any responsible dog owner, I clean up after my dog.  This is especially true in a natural environment, because I know how impactful dog waste can be.

Yesterday was the first time he's pooped on a hike.  I picked it up with a grocery store bag, put that bag in another grocery store bag, and then put those bags in a double seal Ikea bag.  The point of the extra bagging was to not have to deal with whiffs of dog shit on my hike, but I soon learned that even though *I* couldn't smell it, some others could.

Those others were flies.  Within about 10 minutes I was being inundated by a swarm of flies, no doubt attracted to the steaming pile of shit I was carrying in my day pack.  

I thought I could deal with it but it was too much, so I put the poo under a rock and picked it up on the way back.  I know I'm not supposed to do this either, and so that's why I came here.

What do you do in these situations?  Bury it? Is there a brand of bags that will actually stop the smell?  Something else?

39,Anyone have experience with broken Meindl shoes?,"I'm not sure this fits in this sub, since most of you are American and it's not really about gear, but I figured you guys are the most likely to have experience with this. I recently walked the Tour du Mont Blanc but didn't have adequate shoes. Before I started I bought new shoes (bad idea, I know, but I didn't have a choice because I stepped in for someone last minute). I bought these Meindl shoes (Litepeak GTX Lady, because I'm a guy with tiny feet) at a store in Martigny, CH for about €250. These shoes have a cable system they call Variofix, which is a cable that keeps the lowest hooks in place. It runs around the shoe (honestly, I'm not sure what it adds but hey, it looks fancy). Anyway, after waking with them for about two/three hours the hooks of my right shoe somehow hooked into this cable on my left shoe and started ripping it out. After the first damage was done, it happened one or two more times and finally I got stuck so bad it ripped the whole cable out of the guard that should normally prevent this from happening and I fell on the ground, with my heavy backpack, scratching my knee. Me and the person I walked with inspected my shoes and came to the conclusion that it should normally be impossible to hook your shoe into this cable. Hence, it would have to be a production flaw. I duct taped the whole thing together so I could use my shoes anyway for the duration of our trip.

I came back four days ago and I sent an email to Meindl the day after, asking what they can do for me. It's pretty unacceptable that new shoes of €250 break after just a couple of hours of walking. They sent me an email back that I should handle it with the store I bought them at. Problem is, I don't live anywhere close to this place. Now, I'm in luck because I'm passing through the area today and again in two weeks for a holiday with my parents but we are hard pressed for time. I would much rather solve this with Meindl directly. Also, the way they worded it was that I should request the store to give me a solution, implying that if they don't I'm out of luck; Meindl won't do anything. This would be totally unacceptable for expensive shoes. 

Some practical info: I bought the shoes at Ochsner Sport in Martigny and I live in the Netherlands. 

I'm wondering if anyone has experience with a similar situation with Meindl and if you have any tips for me.

A small detail is that while the shoes felt great in the beginning, later on they started hurting my heels like crazy. I can't even wear them now because every step hurts. I'm gonna try them again once my feet are healed but I might have to sell them anyway if it continues. I can't sell them if one shoe is as broken as it is. Another thing I noticed is that the sole of that shoe is already starting to separate from the rest, so that makes a general production flaw in this shoe even more likely.",hiking,1533297333,Creator13,3,1,True,2018-08-03

I want to be prepared for changing weather and full day hikes, but I also need to be minimalistic because we have to pack everything in our suitcase with our other everyday clothes. We’re trying to train for the hikes now, but it’s difficult in the flat VA land near us. We’re not very experienced hikers, but want to see some of the beautiful views you all post, I imagine 10-15 miles is the most we can accomplish in a day.

Otherwise we’re in AirBnbs or hotels. It looks like the weather can be anywhere between 50-90F, so I’m really unsure what to pack. 

I’ve got a 18L hydration pack with a 2.5L bladder to pack everything in, so I don’t have much room. 
Should I look into getting a bigger pack for this? 

Other items I’m planning on taking: 
First aid kit, trekking poles, poncho (no rain cover on the pack), Swiss Army knife, Anker chargers for phones and cameras, some single packs of peanut butter and some meal bars, flashlight, lighter, waterproof bags for the important stuff, water filter kit and purification tablets, Venus to mars FUD, extra socks, emergency Mylar blanket, mosquito net for our heads. 

I’m wearing: north face hiking pants, sports bra, merino wool base layer tank top, moisture wicking t shirt, long sleeve shirt, hat +/- sunglasses, Merrell MOAB 2 waterproof shoes with merino wool socks. I’ll have a Columbia breathable rain jacket and / or a packable down jacket with a hood.

24,Please help me get in shape for the adventure of my life,"I'm not even sure if that's the right place where to post this, but I'm trying my luck.

You see, hiking across the Pacific Crest Trail was always my life dream even since childhood, and next year I might actually have a chance to do that because I'll have to leave my current job, yet not be able to join another one (because of the non-compete clause with my current employer), so I'll basically have a paid sabbatical year. It may also be my last chance to do it, because on one hand I doubt such an opportunity will ever raise again, and on the other hand, because we intend to expand our family and once the kids will come into scene things will get even more complicated. So I would definitely hate missing this chance. The problem is that I'm an overweight (about 250 pounds) and completely out of shape thirty-four years old guy, so even just thinking about hiking through uneven terrain, with a 40-50 pounds backpack and averaging 15-20 miles every day for close to six months sounds pretty darn scaring.

So... how would you suggest me training in order to be able to change myself from a 34 years old sedentary behemoth to a fit adventurer ready to embark on a 2,650 miles hike in less than a year?

\*Later edit (further clarifications):\*

\- Actually, I already started losing weight (even before I found out about my sabbatical year) and I already lost about 45 pounds (started at almost 300), so I guess I can say that I have this somehow in control.

\- I am not completely sedentary, as in I do average about 10-12k steps per day. Is just that I haven't done more than that.

\- Also, since I found about this I already start doing short backpacking sessions (30 minutes at a time) with a 45 pounds back around my neighborhood and I kinda plan to swap most of my walking steps into backpacking steps.

What I guess my main questions are:

\- Hiking every day (even if just for one-two hours) wouldn't represent some form of ""overtraining"" and potentially lead to injuries, like stress fractures or something?

\- While I can find time for two one-hour sessions of walking/hiking per day (one in the morning, before going to work and one in the evening, before dinner), I doubt I could find time for more than this. So how could I actually train my body for longer distances if I don't have time to do said longer distances?

46,Anatomy Of A Hiking Shoe,"*All comments, remarks, and recommendations are welcome.* 

# Introduction

After explaining some of the main characteristics of hiking shoes in our last post, this time we’ll discuss the anatomy of a hiking shoe. Construction of hiking footwear depends on the components, materials, and technologies used. Knowing more about these will help you become much more familiar with the world of hiking shoes and will help you choose the best fit for your feet.

There are two basic parts to a hiking shoe: the *upper*, which is flexible and mold around the foot; and the *sole*, which is more rigid and lies under the foot. The sole is usually made up of several layers. The *insole* lies under the footbed and is usually quite thin. The *midsole* lies between the insole and the outsole and may itself consist of several layers of shock-absorbing and stiffening materials. The *outsole* contacts the ground and has a tread cut into it. The upper and the sole are made separately. When attached, you get a brand new hiking shoe.

https://i.redd.it/dagjnay36hd11.jpg

# Upper

A shoe upper is everything above the sole, i.e. the part of the shoe that encloses the foot and keeps the sole attached to the foot. Upper materials need to mold to the shape of the foot.

### Leather uppers

The most traditional material for hiking shoe uppers, leather has the ability to stretch (with up to 20-30% when steamed to perform stretch over a last) and retain the stretched shape. Additionally, it’s durable, abrasion and puncture-resistant, and breathable. Leather will retain its ability to transmit perspiration vapor when heat builds up within the shoe. It absorbs and disperses moisture quickly and efficiently. It is also flexible and comfortable. The structure of leather provides good tear strength because the fibers aren’t oriented in any fixed direction. Leather consists of three layers - grain (outermost hair side), inner corium central layer, and epidermis. The first two of these are used in hiking footwear production.

In the production of hiking footwear, the most used types of leather are:

* Cowhide
* Nubuck (buckskin leather)
* Suede varieties

There are two basic types of leather: *top-grain* (made from the outer layer of the cow’s hide) and *split-grain* (made from the inner layer of the cow’s hide). Top-grain leather is tougher and thicker than split-grain leather. Moreover, it holds water-repellent treatment and its shape better. Full-grain leather is the full thickness of the hide. It’s rarely used in hiking footwear because it’s tough and water resistant, but also thick and heavy. So when you see a label “full-grain leather” on a hiking boot, keep in mind that it’s probably top-grain leather. Nubuck is top-grain leather that has been sanded and polished to give it a smooth finish similar to suede. It’s tougher and more water resistant than suede, which is split leather. Nubuck is popular with bootmakers because it shows scuffs and scratches less than smooth leathers do and has a sensuous feel. Rough-out and nubuck leathers are easily distinguished from suede by their thickness and solidity. For example, mountaineering boots may have 3-millimeter leather, while hiking shoes 2-millimeter or less.

The *tanning* (treatment or preparation that aids the leather in retaining strength, flexibility, and appearance ) and *finishing* (covers blemishes, protects and improves water resistance) processes give leather its final characteristics.

### Fabric-leather uppers

Many lightweight hiking shoes and boots copy the nylon-suede design of running shoes. This works well for 3-season hiking. It isn’t a good option for snow, though. Uppers are mostly fabric, often nylon mesh in shoes but usually textured nylon in boots, reinforced with leather, suede, or synthetic leather. This design requires many seams, which are vulnerable to abrasion. Moreover, grit and dirt can penetrate nylon much more easily than leather so such membranes do not last as long in synthetic boots as in leather boots.

Fabric-leather hiking footwear is cool in warm weather, it needs little or no breaking in, it’s comfortable, and it dries more quickly than heavier footwear. It’s also used on many of the lightest, most flexible hiking shoes.

### Synthetic leather uppers

Synthetic leather uppers have the advantage of being nonabsorbent and quick dry, though they aren’t very breathable. They often come in combination with nylon.

### Nylon

*Soft nylon* is lightweight, soft and breathable and has been a very popular material for the last 40-50 years. The range of denier used in most sports shoes is from 70D (finest) to 420D (coarsest). *Mesh nylon* is available in varying degrees of strength and hardness. One of the biggest advantages it has is its breathability. Unfortunately, nylons' excellent breathability is often compromised when they are combined with non-breathable foams or backing materials. Another problem area is the use of full-coverage adhesives to combine these breathable materials. The adhesives create a barrier to the movement of air across the upper. When used in coarser grades, mesh nylon gives added strength and body to the shoe. The usual denier of mesh nylon thread is about 400D.

### Plastic

Plastic is better than leather at providing the rigidity, waterproofness, and warmth activities like mountaineering and skiing require. PVC coated leathers or fabrics that have been formed into a single piece of waterproof upper material without stitching are widely used in mountaineering boots and ski boots. But hiking boots need to be flexible and permeable to moisture so that sweat can escape. Plastic hiking boots are just too hot and sweaty for backpacking. 

# Lining

The inside surfaces of the upper are often lined with special materials to protect the foot and enhance comfort. A function of the lining is to serve as a buffer zone between the shoe and the foot. The lining absorbs perspiration from the inside of the shoe and the feet and helps prevent staining of the upper material. It needs to be breathable and moisture-wicking. Traditionally, leather, cotton, and synthetics were the most common lining materials used in footwear, including hiking footwear. Nowadays, although soft leather lining can still be seen in some hiking boots, man-made synthetics are getting more and more popular. They have several advantages over other lining materials: lighter weight, less absorbency, better durability and moisture wicking, and quicker drying.

Commonly used materials for lining are woven nylon, terry loop, and meshes. Thermal insulation properties are important too. In a cold climate, the lining needs thermal microfibres, which are used as insulation.

Many boots now feature linings made from waterproof-breathable membranes such as Gore-Tex and eVent. How long they stay waterproof varies because the membrane itself is fragile, and if your feet move in your boots, the membranes can wear out very quickly. The first membranes leaked fairly quickly, but newer ones last longer.

Waterproof-breathable membranes have another big disadvantage. Although they let some water vapor out, they are far less breathable than non-waterproof footwear. Thus they are hot and sweaty in warm weather and if you get them wet inside, they will get dry slow.

You can read more about waterproofness and waterproof hiking shoes soon on our blog. There will be a special article dedicated to waterproof hiking shoes.

# Insole

The insole is the interior liner placed in a shoe that is in contact with the plantar surface of the foot. It’s usually made of fiberboard, stretch nylon, synthetic foam, or even leather laminated to the top of the footbed’s foam core. The insole needs to be flexible, durable, lightweight, antibacterial/anti-microbial, absorbent and to allow the moisture to pass through it. Many shoes are manufactured with a removable insole that can be replaced with an insole designed for a specific purpose such as odor control, moisture control, arch support, cushioning, reducing foot pain, or foot realignment.

*Prefabricated* insoles are manufactured for odor and moisture control, arch support, and extra-cushioning. They are mass produced and come in a variety of shapes and sizes that can be trimmed to fit a specific shoe size.

*Customized* insoles begin as a prefabricated insole, but have added extra features based on the specific needs of the individual. Minor biomechanical changes can be made to the foot by adding additional pads or wedges to the insole.

*Custom-made* insoles are fabricated from a three-dimensional impression of the individual's foot and require a prescription from a physician. Custom-made insoles are individualized for each patient and designed to change the function and biomechanics of the foot.

# Materials used in soling

### Vulcanized rubbers

Rubber is the most traditional material for shoe soles because it’s durable and versatile. Rubber can be used in different forms, though it’s used primarily in highly compressed molded form or with a blowing agent in microcellular form (MCR). Natural rubber (NR) has outstanding stretchability and excellent low-temperature properties, as well as superior resistance to slip, puncture and cutting, compared to PVC. It has good resistance to acids, bases, alcohols and diluted water solutions of most chemicals that are water-soluble. However, NR will be harmed by constant exposure to petroleum and oil-based solvents.

Natural and synthetic rubbers are polymeric materials possessing characteristic elastic properties. Additionally, there are elastomers – substances, including mixtures containing natural rubber that have rubber-like qualities.

*Styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR)* is low in cost and most commonly used among synthetic rubbers. SBR can vary greatly in quality and composition. It’s a mixture of a natural or synthetic rubber base with additives like accelerators, vulcanizing agents, coloring, filler, and softeners. SBR can be any color and quality depending on the composition and purity of ingredients. A gum color or semi-opaque sole usually indicates a higher quality rubber containing purer materials. However, no visual test can determine the quality of rubber soling. Therefore, the durability and traction of a rubber sole can be identified only through a laboratory analysis or a wear test.

*Nitrile rubber (NBR)* \- The copolymerization of butadiene and acrylonitrile produces these elastomers, which have excellent resistance to petroleum oils, gasoline, mineral and vegetable oils.

*Neoprene (Chloroprene, CR) rubber* \- CR is famous for its balance of properties, unique among the synthetic elastomers. Neoprene has better resistance to oils, ozone, oxidation and heat exposure than natural rubber, but does not have natural rubber’s low-temperature flexibility, preventing its use in low-temperature shock or impact applications.

### Micro-cellular rubber (MCR)

MCR is a compounded mixture of natural rubber and additives that have a cellular structure and is used mainly for midsoles and wedges. It can also be used for outsole material on certain shoes.

### Ethyl-vinyl acetate (EVA)

EVA is a chemical blend of ethylene and vinyl acetate. It’s particularly well-suited as shoe material due to its low cost (compared to natural rubber), light weight, as well as its cushioning effect. Additionally, it’s odorless and glossy. For these reasons, EVA is often used as a shock absorber in hiking shoes.

### Polyurethane (PU)

PU is lightweight, durable, and versatile. It can be used as a midsole and heel wedge component or as an outsole material.

Typically, polyurethanes have a two-component system. Dual-density PU is a combination of a lightweight midsole and wedge with harder outsole material. These elastomeric polymers are waterproof, UV-resistant, glossy, tough at low temperatures, resistant to stress-cracks and are hot-melt adhesive. They are more durable, but also heavier, more expensive, and aren’t as good shock absorbers as EVA.

### Thermoplastics

Among many thermoplastic materials, PVC is the most widely used, low-cost material for solid as well as expanded soles. Modifiers such as Elvaloy add rubber-like performance to PVC. Typically, PVC is compounded with thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) and additional components to become more flexible, abrasion-resistant, oil and water-repellent. PVC has good protection against animal fats, many acids, alcohols, alkalis, bases, oils and petroleum hydrocarbons.

### Liquid polyurethane systems

They’re used for producing lightweight soles with good mechanical properties, water, and oil resistance.

### Nylon

Nylon is a polyester resin with a higher melting point that can be used to form a harder outsole when injected. Common hardness grades include Nylon 6, 11, and 12 (from the hardest to the softest respectively).

# Midsole

This is the location found between the outer sole and the upper of the hiking shoe. Soft, cushioning EVA midsoles in lightweight hiking footwear and heavier but much hardwearing PU are the most-used materials for midsoles. The shock absorption property of hiking shoes, the so-called „cushioning“ is among the most important characteristics of hiking footwear.

The boot sole must support the foot, protect it from shock, and be flexible enough to allow a natural gait. Generally, flexibility is a more important characteristic of hiking shoes than stiffness. The traditional sole stiffener is a half- or three-quarter- length steel shank, only half an inch or so wide, placed forward from the heel to give solidity to the rear of the foot as well as lateral stability and support to the arch while allowing the front of the foot to flex when walking. Full-length shanks are for rigid mountaineering boots, not for walking. Some boots combine a steel shank with a graded nylon insole.

# Outsole

This is the bottom of the hiking shoe that interfaces with the ground. The outsole, with correct traction, gives durability and slip resistance. There are a variety of different materials that are used for outsoles depending upon the activity for which the shoe is designed. Functional properties of the sole are durability, waterproofness, stability, flexibility, rigidity, breathability, thickness, and good traction to the ground.

Аny pattern of studs, bars, or other shapes seems to grip well on most terrain. The key is a pattern that doesn’t allow the shoe to slip. Note that no rubber sole will grip on hard snow or ice. That’s why alpinists use crampons to securely travel on snow and ice.

Generally, the more surface area in contact with the ground the more support the shoe offers the foot.

Some hiking footwear uses the „sticky rubber“. Soles with this material are ideal for scrambling and difficult rocky terrain, but the sticky, soft rubber that grips well on hard, fairly smooth surfaces don’t perform so well on soft/muddy ground. Additionally, it isn’t very durable. Harder rubbers are used for most hiking boot outsoles. They’re more durable and grip better on a wet and muddy terrain.

Many soles combine grip and traction with cushioning. They’re made from a dual-density rubber, as the upper layer is soft and shock-absorbing while the outer layer is hard and durable.

It’s hard to predict tread life but, in general, heavier outsoles with deeper treads outlast lighter soles. The terrain is crucial for wear - pavement and rocks wear out soles faster. Soft ground wears out soles much slower.

# Fastening system

A functional fastening system is an important factor in good hiking shoe fitting. The length, width and the place of the fastening maximize or minimize the performance and comfort. Shoelaces are most often either braided or woven from cotton, nylon or polyester. Laces for hiking shoes are usually braided from durable nylon. Round laces seem to last a bit longer than flat ones.

Boots may be laced up using D-rings, hooks, eyelets, webbing, miniature pulleys, and tiny metal tunnels. The easiest system to use combines two or three rows of D-rings at the bottom of the laces with several rows of hooks or speed lacing at the top. Boots with D-rings alone are harder to tighten precisely. Whatever the type of lacing, many hiking boots have a locking hook offset at the ankle that holds the lace in place even when it’s undone.

# Heel counter

Heel counters are stiff pieces of synthetic (or leather) material built into the rear of hiking shoes or boots to hold the heels in place and support the ankles. If a hiking shoe is to retain its shape, it is necessary to stiffen it at the toe and heel; this leads to the addition of heel counters. Some shoes have a substantial heel counter in order to provide motion control and some leave this out completely. You usually can’t see them but you can feel them under the leather of the heel.

The materials for the heel counters need to be strong and rigid. Natural rubber latex, EVA, hot-melt adhesive and various biocides are some of the most used materials for heel counters.

Most of the synthetic components chosen as a raw material should show good water and oil repellency and must be able to be tailored well to provide other required functional properties such as strength, toughness, flexibility, and durability, etc.

# Toe box

This is the width of the toe region, although toe box can also include the depth or height of the toe region. Depending upon the toe shape of the individual will determine what should fit the best. If toes are contracted or overlap each other then a deeper toe box is needed.

Toe boxes are usually made from materials similar to those used for heel counters.

# Others

### The Tongue

Gusseted tongues with light padding inside are the most comfortable and water resistant. Their main role is to keep pebbles, sand, and debris out of your shoe. A disadvantage of gusseted tongues is that if you are not wearing gaiters, snow can collect in the gussets and soak into the boots. On high-ankle and stiff leather boots, the tongue may be hinged so it flexes easily.

One particular problem area for breathability has been the tongue. Because of the need for padding from lace pressure over the instep, shoemakers have long used a thick layer of foam inside the tongue to protect the foot. Because the instep is also an area where blood vessels come close to the surface of the skin, the tongue should also be especially breathable.

### Seams

Conventional wisdom says the fewer seams, the better because seams may admit water and can abrade. Thus, the most durable and water resistant hiking boots are usually made of one-piece leather with seams only at the heel and around the tongue.

### Adhesives

Shoes are in constant contact with the foot, and adhesives are a key factor in keeping the bond between the hiking shoe lining and insole intact during walking. Adhesives’ polymer properties (like inherent water repellency, bendability, rigidity, elasticity and stain resistance) under the conditions of a broader range of temperature and higher moisture retention levels play key roles in ensuring better performance and comfort. Manufacturers’ use of adhesives which result in shoe allergies can be a major drawback for wearers with sensitive skin. The main adhesives used for gluing in shoe manufacturing are urethane, hot-melt, neoprene and natural rubber.

# Conclusion

The materials and components of a hiking shoe increasingly meet the performance requirements, with more functional characteristics.

Materials and components have properties which ensure comfort, fit, protection, stability and support. They can maximize prolonged wear and retention of the shoe shape, and also play a role in transferring heat and moisture from the foot. A variety of materials such as textiles, leathers, advanced polymeric materials, and composites are used for making hiking shoes.

Materials that can be used for shoe uppers are leather, nylon or polyurethane/neoprene as a solid foam. The main material used for manufacturing outsoles is rubber. Rubber soles grip well on a wide range of surfaces except for snow and ice. Different types of rubber can be used in the hiking footwear industry – from natural rubbers to synthetic blends. Shock absorption is the main function of the midsole. Main midsole materials are EVA (used in lightweight hiking shoes) and heavier but more hardwearing PU. The insole is usually made of stretch nylon, synthetic foam and other materials. It needs to be flexible, durable, lightweight, and to ensure better odor and moisture control. Synthetics are mainly used for hiking shoes’ linings. They are more durable, lighter, wick more moisture and dry quicker than other lining materials. Some other important components of a hiking shoe are a fastening system, tongue, toe box and heel counter.",hiking,1533126458,Camotrek,0,1,True,2018-08-01

79,"Stymied with heel blisters, what to do next?","So I got some new hiking boots earlier this year. I got the same size as my old ones (which I can walk in all day no problems) and made sure the fit was correct - snug but not crazy tight, and if I point my toes down, my feet stay in place supported by the boots, I don't bang my toes on the inside of the boots. So all in all, as far as I can tell I've done everything right with sizing 

I gradually built my way up increasing distance. On steeper uphill bits, I started to notice a bit of heel chafing but it wasn't bad. However, on my most recent hike (22 miles), I had severe blisters on both heels (the left heel had formed a blister, popped, and formed another blister under it. The right heel had two blisters, the larger of which was over 1"" in diameter.

I'm not sure what to do - was this a one off thing where I just needed to form a callus? Should I look I to something like insoles or ENGO patches? What about liner socks? I wore Smartwool socks but it was pretty warm out and my feet got fairly damp, but they started getting bad almost right away so I'm not sure if that was a factor. Do I give up and try something totally different? There wasn't anything I noticed trying them on or during my first couple hikes to indicate this would be a problem, so I am not sure how I would find another pair that doesn't cause problems unless I keep buying different boots.

83,Need Help choosing a LS Base,"Hi /r/hiking,

Planning for non-summer hiking in Australia, temperature ranges from 10C-32C (50F-90F). Mostly around 22C (70F) I'd say.

I have a fair complexion and try to wear long sleeves and a collar outside as much as possible due to serious skin cancer risk (family has had some very, very bad luck). Hence the sleeves. Looking for a base layer that I won't cook in (I am a WARM person at the best of times, never mind on a track with a 10-15KG pack). 

May I please get some feedback on which of these should I be looking at for use while hiking? The TAD product looks like it's more suited to warmer climates, and gives a 'more durable' vibe. But the Kathmandu is 100% Merino, and description says designed for all season hiking. I prefer the colours on the Kathmandu, and it's certainly less of Tacti-Cool vibe than the TAD Atlas (for what its worth). Pricing is about the same once we're in AUD.

93,Is my shin broken?,"**TL;DR: Bumped shin pretty hard on a sharp rock. No bruising, no swelling, can still walk and stand without severe pain. Just a scab + frequent dull aching throughout the day**

Exactly a week ago I went on a long day hike on Mt. Elbert (Colorado), trying to snag another 14er and a state highpoint. On my way down, I was going a little too fast on the loose rocks, lost my balance, and bumped my shin on a protruding rock pretty hard. Right in the middle (~6 inches from the base of the knee), where the skin is the thinnest and you can feel your shin bone pretty well.


The pain was enough to make me stop for a couple of seconds and check the shin out. It looked pretty normal; no bruising, no bleeding, just what appeared to be a nickel-sized cut/scab from the impact. Maybe it was a sharp rock.


I had no problem continuing the rest of the hike (3 miles to the trailhead) without pain. The scab rubbing against my hiking pants stung a little but that's pretty much it.  Later that day I was able to stand in line at KFC without it bothering me either.


Throughout the week, until now, I've had this dull pain around and at the location of the impact. The scab is still there but it's getting smaller. There has been no bruising; doesn't look black or blue. When I press on it with my thumb, I get a dull ache in that location. I wake up with the dull ache as well. What's weird is that sometimes the ache feels like it's coming from just above the ankle, no where near the location of the impact...


A little bit of running, jumping, walking on hard pavement is also enough to trigger the dull pain. None of it is debilitating though. Still, I've taken a week off running to be safe.

I have some [Ahnu Montara](https://www.rei.com/product/803672/ahnu-montara-waterproof-hiking-boots-womens?CAWELAID=120217890000854405&amp;CAGPSPN=pla&amp;CAAGID=15998018800&amp;CATCI=pla-446055108228&amp;cm_mmc=PLA_Google%7C404_155923%7C8036720072%7Cnone%7Cc8d7162e-fa24-44eb-b3a3-662402026bba%7Cpla-446055108228&amp;lsft=cm_mmc:PLA_Google_LIA%7C404_155923%7C8036720072%7Cnone%7Cc8d7162e-fa24-44eb-b3a3-662402026bba&amp;kclid=c8d7162e-fa24-44eb-b3a3-662402026bba&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw4uXaBRAcEiwAuAUz8A6jwVIwT6ifhod95tsgg-9gosd4TxxHWmR_VrRLwQ-aBpc6Suvm-RoCgboQAvD_BwE) boots that I bought in January of 2017. At first I assumed that it was my socks, so after my last multi-day, I bought some darn tough socks. Last weekend I went out for just an overnighter and hiked about 12 miles the first day. Still got blisters. The socks marginally helped. 

I read that having calluses wasn't great for long distance hiking as you can get blisters underneath them, which is what was happening to me. I'm using the baby foot peel right now in hopes that that gets rid of them before my next hike. 

So to my questions. I'll be backpacking the Laugavegur trail in Iceland from Landmannur to Skógar. I want to make sure my feet are OK for the journey. 

1. Should I invest in new hiking boots? 
2. And of so, what recommendations do you have? 3. How should I break them in before a longer trip like this?

For reference, I'm a woman, slightly wide feet, low arches and prefer ankle support and waterproofing. I do most of my hiking in the Appalachians and surrounding areas. 

Thank you so much for all your advice!

62,Rejuvenate: A thought beneath a tree,"Under a new found tree with round leaves and a cold trunk, I lay my body down in a park with islands of bright grass. Weeds filling the park from fence to fence house prancing dogs and hysterical children. A gentle breeze presses against the countless leaves, giving the impression that the trees are joining in the fun, playing among themselves along the outskirts of the greenery. With a bright blue sky overhead it’s hard to believe anyone had decided to stop living in nature, to willingly remove themselves and enter stone walls fed with artificial light and stale air. 

I haven’t slept more than three hours this past week past week. With the cocktail mix of stress and excitement, my body has started to feel the effects of an adrenaline fueled insomnia: my throat is torn up, my nose is constantly bleeding, my legs wobble with every step, my brain feels as if it’s being fried under some sadistic child’s magnifying glass. I’ve been constantly moving, destination after destination in the foreground of my mind.

That sort of wild yet narrow focus takes a toll, a price paid with a slice of the soul. Sitting now in the park is the first time in weeks that I’ve sought out relaxation, just wanting to plop wiggle my toes around in the dirt. As my body-print falls deeper in the soft ground I can feel my breathing slow and my mind calm as I soak up the nature. The smell of the trees, the sing song of the foreign birds, the hum of clumsy bees. The cool earth below my skin filters out the manic and knotted energy hidden within. It’s as if my body is soaking in the environment itself and slowly permeating it within myself, making me feel just as calm as those leaves in the soft wind. Like drinking ice cold water on a mid-summers day, I can feel the nature move throughout my body and pull out the stressful energy that sticks to my mind. 

There’s a certain high when surrounded by greens and blue, as you soak up the flowing visuals and sounds.

87,10 Important Characteristics Of Hiking Shoes Explained,"*All comments, remarks, and recommendations are welcome.*  

## Introduction

Footwear is intended to provide comfort for wearers and offer good protection for human feet against harsh conditions. The main purposes of hiking shoes are to protect your feet against bruising and abrasion from rough wilderness terrain, to cushion your soles, and to provide good traction on a rough, steep, slippery, wet, and muddy terrain. Additionally, trekking shoes must offer enough stability and be durable. A reliable hiking shoe is a long-lasting hiking shoe that won’t leave you in the middle of the trail. For long-distance backpacking, shoes need to be supportive and it’s better if they’re light. Shoes also need to feel flexible and comfortable in hiking, though on rough surfaces they might have to be stiffer and more supportive.

Hiking footwear also needs to be functional and be able to respond to changing environments, for example, changing surface types. Functional footwear materials and construction go hand in hand. This time we are going to discuss some of the most important physical and non-physical characteristics of trekking shoes and boots. Soon, we will post more about the components of hiking shoes as well as the materials from which they are made of. These two come hand in hand – the perceived characteristics of a pair of hiking shoes depend very much on the materials used for making the footwear as well as on their components.

# Fit of hiking shoes

No matter how well a hiking shoe is constructed, it will not function properly if it does not fit well.

Shoemakers say \`the last is first' to reinforce the importance of properly fitting footwear. The last is the foot-shaped form on which shoes are made, and the shape of the last has a significant influence on fit. Fit directly influences comfort. Proper fit is also a prerequisite of function.

Providing mass-produced hiking shoes with a good fit is a challenging goal. For example, if a shoe manufacturer expects to fit 90% of their male customers with size 43, they will have to accommodate men weighing anywhere from 60 kg to 100 kg. In addition to this individual variability, people typically have different sized left and right feet. Their feet change in length, width, girth, and volume throughout the day and even during a given sports activity. Feet are active during hiking and backpacking, foot shape is exceedingly dynamic and no static last shape can produce perfect fit in all situations and at all times for all people.

Fit is difficult to quantify because there is much subjectivity involved in how a person perceives the right fit. One person may prefer a tight fit, while another may prefer a looser fitting shoe.

The benefits of shoes that fit well are the following:

* Stability and support for the foot
* Protection from foot injuries
* Shock-absorption and comfort
* Prolonged wear and retention of shoe shape

What is a good fitting of the hiking shoe? The shoe needs to have a shape and dimensions which maintain good health. Good fitting also means comfort in most cases. The optimal underfoot shape also gives a good fitting, if it is checked carefully. Insole and socks need to be checked as carefully as styling to ensure they fit the user. Generally, trekking shoes do not fit as firmly as fashion shoes. Our feet normally expand by 5% during the day. Keep this in mind when choosing hiking shoes. As a rule, boots should fit snugly around the heel, ankle, and instep but have room for you to wiggle your toes.

Proper fitting of footwear to feet involves understanding feet, shoes, and the selection of shoes to achieve a required fit. With respect to feet, many sources of foot anthropometry are available. However, since the footwear sizing system is primarily based on foot length but footwear manufacturers resort to using length, width and girth measures, a mismatch in any dimension generally results in poor fitting.

# Traction

Resistance to slippage, the so-called “traction” has long been a selling feature for companies claiming exclusive tread patterns or outsole designs. To measure traction, manufacturers conduct tests to determine the coefficient of friction and the slip resistance characteristics for shoes or materials under varying surface conditions. The coefficient of friction is a number between 0 and 1 indicating the slip-resistance of a material. The closer the value to 1, the slipping is less likely.

Slips usually occur when a foreign substance such as water, sand, ice or mud comes between the shoe and the surface. Two types of slippage are possible in most activities. The foot can slip forward or sideways upon initial contact with the surface, or it can slip backward during the push-off phase. Although the most dangerous slip is probably in the forward direction, most tests have been done to simulate push-off slip.

Hiking shoe traction is achieved with an increase in outsole traction and with midsole stability.

# Breathability

The fact that the shoe covers the foot results in an inside environment different from the surrounding air. The temperature and humidity will always be greater inside the shoe. The more the upper materials can transmit the moisture, the greater the reduction of perspiration around the foot. The more moisture absorbs, the more breathable the material, resulting in greater comfort. Simple perforation can also be used to improve the breathability of trekking shoes and it can be quite effective.

Synthetic materials are usually more permeable than leather. The most common man-made materials in hiking shoe uppers are nylon meshes. The use of combinations of materials is common. Layering is also widespread. All these factors affect the overall breathability of the hiking shoe.

# Weight

For most good hikers, the weight of the shoe is an important consideration. That’s why while many prefer wearing lightweight hiking shoes, some give more credit to boots as more reliable hiking footwear.

Wearing heavy backpacking boots results in greater energy demands, thus hindering performance; however, it can also provide more ankle support and stability on the trail, especially if you carry a large and heavy pack. The general trend is to reduce shoe weight as much as possible without sacrificing performance, protection, and other characteristics. Generally, shoe weight must be evaluated relative to other features. Even though the foot and shoe weigh relatively little, the weight factor is an important one to consider. We have already noted in a previous article that a kilo on the shoe feels like five to six kilos on the back. That’s because the foot and shoe are at the farthest distance from the hip axis, any added weight requires much greater muscle force to move it. Additionally, the foot moves through a longer distance than any other part of the leg. A reasonable backpacker needs to find the balance between the reduction in shoe weight and other important features (such as traction and cushioning).

The lightness of the shoe is achieved mainly via the choice of upper materials and by using less cushioning.

# Cushioning

Cushioning, in short, is the ability of a shoe to absorb shock. Most companies use cushioning and shock absorption interchangeably. Thus, regarding trekking shoes, shock absorption and cushion are different terms for the same thing.

The human body has the ability to sense damaging motions as discomfort or pain. Poor cushioning ratings are a good predictor of discomfort and pain in feet. But how does cushioning work in reality? A cushioning system functions by increasing the duration of an impact, thereby reducing the shock load transmitted to the musculoskeletal system. During walking, the ground reaction force is approximately 1.25 times the body weight and during running, the ground reaction force can reach levels of 2 to 3 times the body weight. Thus, midsole cushioning is supposed to attenuate or dampen the impact forces acting on the body during usage.

In the early days, rubber was used as a cushioning material. Nowadays, cushioning technology is quite varied with manufacturers marketing all sorts of air soles, pads, gel or fluid soles.

Some 20 years ago, Salomon Brothers industry report stated:

""*No company has publicized that its cushioning* *technologies outperform another because generally, these cushioning technologies perform no better than* *regular polyurethane (PU) or ethylene-vinyl-acetate (EVA) foam. Investing in the creation and strong marketing* *of these technologies provides credibility to companies that their product will actually help with true athletic* *performance, and thus helps give a specific brand an aura* *of being an authentic athletic brand*"".

Today, EVA and PU are still the most widespread materials for hiking shoe midsoles.

Even though midsole cushioning is supposed to attenuate or dampen the forces on the body, the actual force acting on the body remains relatively unchanged with footwear. Thus, most problems arise when a wearer of a shoe perceives a relatively false sense of security. What’s interesting is that this false sense of security increases impact and injury with users of expensive shoes. Why is that? The main reason is that users of expensive shoes tend to underestimate the loads (or alternatively expect the shoes to protect their feet) and hence are more prone to injury. Another interesting finding was made in the 90s when three-quarter cut aerobic shoes were associated with a higher number of aerobic injuries. Apparently, it was perceived that the wearers had a false sense of security about ankle protection with the three-quarter-ankle shoes. That’s what often happens on the trail as well. Some hikers overestimate the ankle support and protection provided by their footwear and as a consequence, they suffer an injury.

# Comfort

The ideal in-shoe microclimate is a boundary layer of air around the foot approximately 29°C with low relative humidity. Though keeping the hiker's foot cool and dry is mainly a matter of comfort, it prevents the formation of blisters too.

Oxygen consumption and fatigue have been strongly correlated with comfort. If a hiking shoe is making the user consume more oxygen and the muscle activity is higher, then it is understandable that the user will feel uncomfortable in that shoe. Improving the comfort of a shoe can result in a reduction in stress-related injuries. The breadth of the forefoot can also influence the perception of comfort. As a rule, narrow and shallow shoes lead to a higher incidence of forefoot injury. However, the fit of the hiking shoe is not solely sufficient for comfort. Differences in comfort have been associated with changes in muscle activity, foot shape, fit between foot and footwear, foot sensitivity, the weight of the shoe, and temperature.

Even though footwear sales are increasing every year, the functionality and performance characteristics of footwear do not follow a similar trend. Product performance can be broadly evaluated based on its function, form, and fit. Even though it is well known that fit or product compatibility is necessary for a person to experience comfort, safety, and satisfaction during use, the form has dominated the design and development of footwear over the last few decades.

Most people are able to identify what is a comfortable and non-comfortable shoe. This measure, therefore, can be adopted in the assessment of footwear fitting. Materials, especially on linings, are also important for a comfortable feel. Regarding the choice of lining material, you need to think how moisture will be absorbed from the lining. Mesh lining is a good solution since it is breathable, moisture-wicking and quick dry.

# Support and stability

Stability of the hiking shoe is achieved with cushioning, medial support and with a semi-curved or curved last: it supports foot movement. Proper design and correct inserts give additional stability.

Controlling a motion is achieved with a heavy, more rigid, and durable shoe, and by limiting overpronation. Movement control is also achieved via the design of the midsole and waist area.

The notion that for better ankle support, when carrying a heavy pack or hiking on rough terrain, you need heavy, stiff footwear. However, most walking boots offer little ankle support, because of their soft cuffs. Only boots with high, stiffened cuffs give real ankle support. But the stiff ankle support restricts foot movement so much that when you walk in these boots, your walk is seriously hindered. Apparently, stiff-ankled boots and natural foot movement do not go together. Generally, it’s much better strengthening your ankles than torturing your feet in heavy, rigid boots.

Some of the greatest strain on your ankles occurs when you run over steep, rough ground. Yet trail runners never wear boots but low-cut and much lighter footwear. For traversing steep, rugged terrain, you need strong, flexible ankles and lightweight hiking shoes.

# Stiffness

An argument in favor of heavy boots to lightweight hiking shoes is that stiff soles protect your feet from rough terrain and help support heavy loads. However, this way you restrict natural foot movement which can make you feel unstable.

Stiff soles can’t flex enough to accommodate to the terrain. They may prevent you from placing your feet naturally, leading to a slow and unnatural gait possibly leading to an injury. Additionally, straining against the stiffness is energy-consuming and tiring.

Sole stiffness is required only on a rough and snowy terrain. That’s one of the reasons why mountaineers prefer wearing rigid boots.

# Durability

The durability of hiking shoes depends on the material, technology used, the terrain as well as the weather conditions (including humidity). Synthetics are much more prone to abrasion damage than leather hiking shoes. If you like hiking on rough and rocky terrain, you need sturdy hiking shoes or boots, preferably with an upper made of leather.

In general, a pair of leather boots is not only going to hold up better to the elements but also last longer as far as general wear and tear are concerned.

Durability in the upper is achieved with toe bumpers and stitching, and in the sole with materials and traction design.

# Protection

A pair of good trekking shoes needs to protect your feet against harsh conditions on the trail. To some extent it depends on the weight of the shoes (heavier trekking shoes or boots often, though not necessarily always, provide better protection) however much more important for good foot protection is the material that your hiking shoes have been made of as well as some additional features such as toe cap. When hiking on a rough terrain, you need additional protection not only for your feet and heels but for your toes as well. Rubber toe caps provide additional protection for your toes acting as a buffer between you and the twigs and branches that you encounter on your way. Another useful feature offering better protection for your foot can be an integrated gusseted tongue since it keeps pebbles, sand, and debris out of your hiking shoe.

## Conclusion

Our feet are unique and they have special requirements. One style will not fit all and therefore it is difficult to make a general prescription for appropriate hiking shoes.

Good trekking shoes need to offer a balance between light weight, support, and stability; cushioning and functionality; stiffness and breathability. They must also be durable, protect your feet, and provide comfort. And above all, they need to fit. Fit is closely related to comfort and no matter how many functional features a shoe might possess, if it doesn’t fit, people simply won’t buy it. The appearance is also important. As with fit, if the shoe is unappealing to the eye, most consumers won’t buy it.

There is an axiom that the shoes designed to excel at one function will almost surely fail at another. However, today you can find wonderful shoes for almost every use. Today’s trekking shoes are far superior to what existed years ago. Nowadays, design, construction, and functionality have become more crucial than the identifying logo.",hiking,1532687793,Camotrek,6,1,True,2018-07-27

62,~3 Days in Banff - Choosing The Right Hikes,"I'm heading out to Banff next weekend. We're planning on leaving Calgary early Saturday morning and are camping at Two Jack Main Sat, Sun, Mon. We leave for Jasper on Tuesday via Icefields and are camping in Pocohontas that night, so we've got a decent amount of driving ahead of us and can't do a full day in Banff on Tues.

With that in mind, suggestions on which of these to prioritize over Sat, Sun, Mon? This is just what I've gathered in research, so other suggestions are also welcome:

- Healy Pass or Cory Pass-Mt Edith Circuit (research suggests one of these would be an all-day hike).
- Johnston's Canyon+ the Inkpots
- Cascade Amphitheater (I've heard the views aren't actually that great, but it's a good length for a half-day)
- Plain of Six Glaciers or Little/Big Beehive at Lake Louise
- Larch Valley and/or Tower of Babel at Moraine Lake

I'm tempted to spend a day each on Moraine Lake and Lake Louise, since people seem to love them, but it'd mean very early mornings since we're staying in Banff and it'd eliminate the option of doing an all-day hike, since we need to check in to our campsite on Saturday around 1pm.

We could also try doing Lake Louise or Moraine Lake on Tues on our way out to Jasper, but I'm concerned about the length of the day if we try and do those AND then drive all the way up to Pocohontas, with stops along Icefield.

115,Seeking Kungsleden Advice,"Hello,

My wife and I are hiking the northern 60 miles of the Kungsleden next month. I have a few questions that I'm still struggling with, and would love some guidance.

1. Travel insurance. I've never really thought too much about it. I do recall that the difference between emergency rescue in the US and Europe is that for the US, as long as you aren't doing something illegal it's covered, but in Europe it's basically considered presumed risk, and you're responsible for the whole cost. 

Do you think it's worth it? Necessary?  It's about $150 for the 2 of us, which seems reasonable. I've never gotten it for myself, but I'm kind of dumb. 

2. Pack. I currently have a 28, 38, and 85 liter pack. I'm having a goldilocks situation for finding the right temp porridge. I tried all my gear in the 38, and it fit barely, but that's without any of our food (which I'll be carrying the bulk of), so it's just a bit too small. A 50 or at most 60 liter pack would be ideal. But it's potentially something I use once and never have a need for again. 

The 85 liter pack is obv too big, but weighs about the same as a 60 liter one. Is it that bad to use the 85, and just fill it 2/3 full? It has a lot of cinching straps, and has also been custom fitted for me, so it's very comfortable. Online, I keep seeing people say that if you have an oversize pack you'll just fill it, but to counteract that I've created a spreadsheet with each item to go in, to keep the weight down. 

3. The need for Satellite Comms systems. This is a commonly traveled hike, with staffed huts 8ish miles apart from each other. All the huts list having emergency radios. Is having our own satellite communications device (like the Spot or the Garmin Explorer) overkill? I've seen varying opinions. We'd never be more than 2ish hours away from a hut. It's remote, but not *that* remote.  

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

It sounded like \*humph\* \*humph\*, with two to three repetitions occurring a couple seconds apart. The rhythm and pronunciation was similar to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQDjtlNLdaE), but in a *much* lower register with more force. It didn't sound guttural or aggressive, but it was definitely coming from an animal larger than a groundhog. If you spend time around rabbits, the animal sound reminded me of my pet rabbit when he's trying to get it on with another rabbit (if you know what that sounds like).

We heard the sounds coming from the forest near the start of the Marble Mountain pass (near the southern base of the mountain). We couldn't identify exactly where the sound was emanating from, but it seemed to be close to the ground. We heard it twice about 150 feet apart, which means it either followed us or there were two in close proximity. There was snow on the ground, but there were some clear areas as well. The area was dominated by coniferous trees, with a few deciduous thrown in for show.

This occurred on May 18th, south side of Mount Saint Helen's near the base.

Unfortunately no one else wanted to do it with me because it looked far too exposed/dangerous. Also I am obese, and not very fit, so I wasn't sure myself if I could manage 900m of ascent.

In the end, it turned out to be more of a ""seeing family"" holiday anyway, rather than an adventurous holiday. I was a bit disappointed  - both by my family not wanting to do more strenuous stuff, and by my own lack of fitness holding me back.

Dad said that if I could get fit and lose a bit of weight, he'd take me somewhere for a weekend in 5 weeks' time, as a goal to motivate both of us into getting a bit fitter.

What are the best scramble walks/mountain walks in the UK? Preferably somewhere nearer than the Lake District because that was a 5 hour drive for us. 

I looked up Snowdonia (marginally closer than the Lake District) and found ""Tryfan"" which looks awesome, and very exciting. Does that climb require any technical skills, and is it dangerous or exposed? 

I used to do climbing a few years ago, and also used to love other outdoor pursuits such as kayaking and canyoneering/coasteering. I'm now too overweight to do any of those activities (I can't fit into my climbing harness and I practically sink the kayak), but I still possibly have a bit of relevant skill with climbing.

Would it be feasible to attempt Tryfan in 5 weeks' time? If not, are there any other walks which include some easier/less exposed scrambles? We've not decided on Snowdonia yet so it could be pretty much anywhere in England.

And also, what would be the best training/fitness routine for getting in shape to do hillwalking? 

There aren't many big hills around where I live (Berkshire). I sometimes cycle into the Chilterns but I don't think cycling exercises the same muscles as climbing/hillwalking, judging by how much my quadriceps and calf muscles hurt last week.

Most amateur hikers need only a pack, sturdy and comfortable hiking shoes or boots, and appropriate hiking outfit to keep them warm and comfortable in low temperatures and cool and comfortable in high temperatures. (For more info about basic hiking equipment check out: Packing for a Day Hike or Packing for a Multi-day Hike)

Hiking clothing encompasses a wide range of products. At the core of this market are clothes that may be considered for hiking but also cross into other outdoor activities such as mountaineering, trail running, mountain biking, and winter sports.

It is an accepted practice to use a layered clothing system for safe and enjoyable participation in these sports. This allows the wearer to adapt his hiking clothing in response to changing comfort or weather demands. The three layers are the following:

* Base layers that are worn next to the skin and designed to rapidly wick sweat away from the body. They have moisture management, cooling effect, anti-UV, odor control, quick dry properties. They’re used in sportswear as a first layer or base layer.
* Mid layers, which trap air and create insulation. Mid layer clothing is used in order to prevent heat loss from the body.
* Outer layers consist of windproof and water resistant shells that protect the underlying layers from wind and rain.

All layers are engineered to move moisture through and out of the clothing system.

Sweating is the main way of body cooling during outdoor activities. Sweat must be evaporated to create a cooling effect, and the latent heat required to achieve this is taken from the body surface. The process is most efficient when the humidity is low. Therefore hiking clothing must be engineered for the efficient transfer of water vapor and liquid sweat, which might otherwise accumulate in fabric layers and lead to discomfort. This is achieved through wicking and breathability.

Water collected in fabric layers decreases garment insulation by displacing trapped still air and conducting heat away from the skin. The more water accumulated, the greater the reduction in insulation. That’s why cold temperatures combined with windy weather can lead to hypothermia. It is important that the outer shell of the layered clothing system must also provide a buffer from wind and rain, i.e. it should be windproof and waterproof or water-resistant.

Creating a modern hiking outfit presents a complex problem for the manufacturers. Hiking clothing must address constantly shifting comfort needs, which change according to energy demands and weather conditions over a long period of time.

## Base Layers

### Features of base layers

The base layer has two main properties: it has to be skin-friendly (comfortable) and it has to be moisture-wicking and quick dry, as the insulation of wet fabrics is reduced.

A base layer is used to manage moisture next to the skin, rapidly dispersing sweat to prevent chilling and encouraging efficient evaporation at the garment outer surface. Ideally, the liquid is diffused over a wide area in the outer layer, where it can dry quickly, while the body stays dry. The movement of moisture along a fiber surface is referred to as “wicking”. Garments are elastic, allowing the fabric to remain in contact with the skin while maintaining freedom of movement.

The wicking properties of the base layer mainly depend on the capillary structure of the fabric, as well as the moisture absorption capacity and the surface properties of the fibers used. This allows moisture to diffuse until all areas of the garment are equally wet. However, the transport is influenced by the amount of sweat present.

The amount of sweat absorbed by the base layer is mainly dependent on the fiber type and fabric thickness. The absorption of moisture in hygroscopic fibers (especially wool) generates heat, which may have a positive effect on thermal comfort. Some scientists favor a wool base layer to keep athletes warm and dry in sports in cold conditions.

### Base layers fabrics

Human skin can probably distinguish different amounts of water in a fabric, but this seems to be dependent on the material used. Differences in humidity levels could only be discerned in cotton, but not in polyester or other synthetics.

Polyester is the most commonly used fiber because it’s relatively cheap, easy to care for, and readily modified. It’s hydrophobic which effects moisture movement, without absorption, resulting in a quick drying fabric. It can also be modified in different ways. COOLMAX is one example of a modified polyester fiber allowing moisture to disperse and evaporate quickly while being highly air permeable to improve drying time.

Polypropylene has very low moisture absorption and good wicking properties. The fibers are soft, however, it tends to absorb oil, which leads to odor retention.

Merino wool is highly absorbent. Each fiber has a structure that allows it to stretch, recover, and insulate effectively. It is hygroscopic, which allows it to absorb moisture into the central structure of the fiber, without feeling damp or clammy. As moisture is absorbed, the hydrogen bonds in the water molecules are broken and chemically react with the molecules in the wool fiber to generate heat. This provides warmth in cold conditions while absorbing perspiration and facilitating thermoregulation in warm conditions.

## Mid Layers

### Features of mid layers

The main purpose of mid layers is to trap air next to the skin and provide additional insulation. Nowadays, these layers are often made of fleece materials. The thermal resistance of such layers is directly correlated with their thickness if no air movement occurs within the fabric.

Several thin layers may be worn or carried depending on the weather conditions. Polyester fleece, down, or synthetic-filled jackets and tops are the most commonly produced clothes of this type.

### Mid layers fabrics

Fleece fabric is manufactured from polyester, which is hydrophobic and dries quick. Air is trapped between the fibers in the pile, creating insulation. The fabric is lightweight, breathable, durable, and easy to care for.

Down traps air and provides insulation. However, it is easily damaged when compressed and stored, can absorb a significant amount of water and subsequently collapse.

## Outer Layers

### Features of outer shell layers

The outer shell layer is used to protect the mid and base layers from the outside weather conditions - mainly water (rain and snow) and wind. Water resistant jackets are considered a vital piece of equipment in places with unpredictable weather and are worn or carried for participation in outdoor activities. However, using one of these may rapidly feel hot and clammy during periods of high energy expenditure because they present a barrier to the evaporation of sweat. Therefore, the fabric must be breathable.

In order to avoid excessive sweat accumulation, the outer layer should allow moisture transfer from the body to the environment. The waterproof properties and the water vapor transfer are either achieved with a microporous or a hydrophilic structure, or a combination of both. Waterproofness and breathability are contradictory requirements which means that a compromise has to be made between protection and comfort properties.

Microporous structures contain pores that are permeable to single water vapor molecules, but impermeable to water drops. They can be achieved through tightly woven fabrics, microporous membranes, and coatings or through electrospun nanofibrous structures.

Hydrophilic membranes are non-porous polymer structures and the water vapor transport takes place through the absorption of water molecules and their subsequent transport. These structures swell when they take up moisture. For this reason, a hydrophilic liner is sometimes laminated on the inner side of the membrane. Additionally, it gives the membranes stability.

The waterproof and breathable fabric (WBF) is usually the layer with the highest water vapor resistance. In rainy conditions, the water vapor permeability may be impaired if water is absorbed by the outer shell. Therefore, it is very important that the outer shell layer is treated with a durable water repellent (DWR).

### Outer shell layers fabrics

Microporous fabrics are lightweight, densely woven, synthetic fiber structures that are coated or laminated with a polymer. This adds a durable system of microchannels, which are permeable to water vapor molecules, but impermeable to larger liquid water molecules. Laminates are manufactured from expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) and polyurethane (PU), which is cheaper. The first ePTFE laminate was manufactured by Gore-Tex and is still used in a high proportion of hiking clothes.

Hydrophilic coatings and laminates are engineered from polyurethane or polyester polymers. Water is transferred through these materials by a chemical molecular process. They can be added in thin layers to the face of microporous fabrics to improve oil-resistance.

Water vapor transfer is driven down a temperature and humidity grade until a balance is reached on each fabric face. Therefore, diffusion of moisture will be most effective when the ambient temperature and humidity are lower than inside the clothing system. In such conditions, ePTFE laminates have the best breathability performance, followed by hydrophilic and PU microporous laminates and then PU coatings. However, in rainy conditions, micropores can become blocked by condensation and rain, reducing breathability.

The base fabric is usually nylon or polyester, which are both hydrophobic and durable; conversely, the membrane is relatively fragile. The composite structure of a base fabric and membrane described this way is referred to as a 2-layer laminate. This is a classic shell fabric that is used in most hiking and mountaineering jackets. A 2.5-layer laminate has a protective, raised pattern overprinted on to the membrane, which removes the need for a lining. This reduces overall garment weight, making it appropriate for fast and light activities such as trail running and mountain biking. In a 3-layer laminate, the membrane is sandwiched between the base fabric and a softly knitted backing. This results in a heavier but much more durable fabric, which is suitable for professional hiking and mountaineering jackets.

The biggest recent innovation in the shell-fabric market has been the rapid development of perfluorinated chemical (PFC) free membranes and DWR coatings. PFCs ensure better water repellency. However, they are persistent and accumulate in the food chain, causing serious health issues such as hormone disruption, cancer, and immune suppression in children.

## Layered clothing systems: a shift towards a fourth layer - the softshell

In the classic three-layered clothing system, each layer offers a specific function. Base layers worn next to the skin are designed to wick away humidity to the outer layers, to stay dry and to offer thermal protection in cold weather. Mid layers focus on thermal insulation and to draw moisture away from the skin to the outer layer. Outer layers protect from the rain, snow, and wind. Combined, these three layers are designed to work together to offer overall comfort and protection. The classic layered clothing system is well adapted to outdoor activities, from hiking and backpacking to cycling.

Nowadays, waterproofness is not considered a feature necessary at all times anymore. On average, a water resistant garment will be necessary 10% of the time whereas high breathability is fundamental in 90% of sports activities. Rain protection has been overestimated in the past, especially in summer collections where total waterproofness is rarely necessary and often reduces clothes breathability.

Breathability becomes the main performance feature and the focus shifts to the second layer which is becoming the pivotal garment in outdoor collections. This new mid layer is designed to offer: elasticity, wind protection and a degree of thermal insulation or water resistance. This is just one of many possible configurations of softshell jackets.

Softshells situate between mid and outer layers. They are comprised of densely knitted base fabrics laminated with a membrane and wicking, or thermal fleece material on the reverse. Such fabrics are usually more breathable than water-resistant fabrics and provide warmth, flexibility, and wind resistance. 

The renewed focus on breathability over waterproofness implies reorganizing the layered clothing system in such a way that the main item is no longer the outer layer, but the second layer, the softshell.

Few people outside the outdoor industry understand the terms hardshell or softshell when applied to clothes. Softshells feature many functions and have been made possible through advances in textile technologies. Fleeces can be very warm, but they are not capable of protecting the wearer from cold wind. Their thermal properties need to be supplemented by a windproof shell either as a separate item of clothing or by bonding the fleece to a membrane or a textile (thus getting a softshell).

Softshells, which are advanced composite textiles are often sold at prices similar to, or higher than, hardshells. Designed for intense activities, they combine ease of movement and protection. In many cases, softshells are also water resistant. They generally resist water penetration for about half an hour, time enough to find shelter, or to put on a waterproof jacket. A softshell jacket designed for lightweight and compact protection is easy to store in a backpack and pull on when conditions get rough. The waterproof and breathable jacket (once the most important item of a layered clothing system) has shifted to the light, fast and efficient softshell. The arrival of this new category means the outdoor market is moving to a four-layer system in very cold and extreme conditions. Then, the wearer will combine four garments: base layer, fleece, softshell and an insulation jacket for maximum warmth and protection.

## Conclusion

Nowadays, it’s recognized that only complete layering concept can ensure the optimal performance of hiking clothing.

In a layered clothing system, base layers are worn as a constant. A variable number of mid layers are carried, depending on the weather. Outer layers are only worn in cold, windy, and wet conditions. To maintain comfort, items must be adjusted according to weather conditions and perceived exertion. Any adjustments should be effortless and efficient; garments must support comfort and performance.

It is crucial that clothing fits well while accommodating layers. However, it must also allow freedom of movement while performing activity specific movements.

When adjusting layers, the whole construction (comprised of all three layers) has to be considered as the different layers interact with one another. The thermal resistance of any two layers is usually higher than the sum of the two single layers.

To sum up, in order to offer an optimal protection, hiking clothing basically has to provide good insulation, be waterproof (water resistant), windproof and breathable.",hiking,1532180745,Camotrek,14,9,True,2018-07-21

107,Boot recommendations,"Hello all,

Thank you for your time.

So, my trusty boots of the past 6 years are probably due replacement... They might last summer, but no way will they get through another alpine winter.

So, I was after recommendations... Honestly I know very little about what makes a good boot, I've just always preferred comfortable, and leather and this has done me fine for every hike I've been on at any time of year.

So if any of you have good ideas of an all round boot that will get you through snow and mud, or things I should really be looking for in a boot, that would be amazing!

One thing I did notice about these boots last weekend, is that hiking on smooth stone was a bit of a nightmare, had near zero grip on it and getting a hold with my toes on scramble sections was a bit difficult as well. So if you know a type of sole or design that overcomes this it would be great!

I've been looking online a bit but also wanted to get some hiker perspective on this since it's really only flared up when I've been on inclines. 

How to fix what hurts now: I've been reading ice and ibuprofen, which I'll do. I imagine rest will also do it good but I'm not sure for how long. Any other suggestions? 

Preventing future strain: any favorite stretches, techniques or anything else you'd like to share? I've heard that a shorter gait can help. I've also heard that trekking poles can help. I've been a little resistant to them previously, but since this seems to be a recurring issue I might need to take the plunge... If I go the poles route, is it best to buy 2 or will one on the bad side get me by?

I am doing the arctic circle trip in 10 days, and I am trying to plan out my meals. I have made meal-packs for each day containing a dry-meal of approx. 450-500 Kcal and 2 energy bars of approx. 500 Kcals + various snacks of extra Kcals.

I'd like to try [Altras](https://www.altrarunning.com/), but they aren't currently available in any retail stores in my city, and I don't want to buy any shoes I can't try on in a store.

I live in a very small city (not in North America) where the range of footwear in our retail stores is terrible in comparison to bigger cities.  I've got some Keen Targhees, and while they are great in harsh rocky/boulder terrain, they are just way too stiff (sole - heel to toe) when on more casual trails.  I am looking for a pair of shoes that have:

- Very wide toe box (like Keens).

- Not a Zero Drop, but a lower drop than Targhees.

- Much more flex in the sole from heel to toe, more suited to more ""casual"" trails - not hardcore boulders.  

- More ""ground feel"" than the Targhees.

Seemingly the most suitable models available to me are:

- [Keen Aphlex](http://www.keenfootwear.com.au/Products?q=Aphlex) models.

- [Keen Versavent](http://www.keenfootwear.com.au/Products?q=Versavent) models.

53,Seeking Beginner's Hiking Trip Advice,"Hey guys! I wanted to get some advice on how I should plan a hiking trip I want to take. I'll start by saying that have virtually no experience in hiking. I live in Florida, but frequently visit family in Massachusetts where there are a couple hiking trails I have learned over the past couple of years. Probably the longest hike I've done at this point was about 7 miles. But, what I'm looking for in this trip is an organized hike that ideally would take about 3-4 days. I definitely don't want to get in over my head, but at the same time I want to push myself and have the best experience possible. At this point it would have to be with a group as I have very little (zero) knowledge about how to pack/plan a hike like that. I know there are probably hundreds of these types of organized hikes, so I'd love to be pointed in the right direction!

This trip would take place in the end of October, so hopefully that's plenty of time to plan everything. I'm very serious about this... it really sucks that I live in Florida because pretty much all I do when I visit other places is look for hiking trails I can explore. 

Just a little background about me: I'm a 27 year old woman. I consider myself to be in pretty good shape. I live on a beach (which I absolutely love), so I'm pretty much running/biking/swimming at some point every day of the week. I'm looking for a challenge ;) 

Also, it would be great to get general advice about how to start hiking as a serious hobby. I live in Miami, so there aren't exactly any groups I can join (that I know about!). If there were, I'd be all over that. Help me make this into a serious hobby, guys!!

42,Lessons learned on rocky peak,"Lesson learned Yesterday on [Crowders Mountian trails] (https://www.ncparks.gov/crowders-mountain-state-park) 
Crowders Trail to Rocktop Trail to Pinnacle Trail (where I fell)

    
If you have two routes to go up take the rocker one because falling into rocks is much better than falling down on ROCKS...

    
Also, the Pinnacle should be done early almost falling off the ledge should always be avoided when alone and it's hard to walk down in the dark with a sprained ankle (always carry a headlamp)...

    
Always check in at the office (if there is one) let them know what trail you are going on  ... Have the rangers number saved to your phone so they can come to get you or meet you along the trail to offer help
 
      
I won't be going to up a hill for a while ...Only flat and easy but long trails till I heal up

    
will not do it alone if I do change my mind...

    
I'm lucky my knee got hung around a dead tree with a big dead tree branch stub so I grabbed a sapling or rock (I honestly do not remember) I was able to pull myself up and hobble to an area to sit and call the ranger I made it down just after 9:30... 

    
Park closes up 9 pm lucky for me there was a ranger waiting for me...

73,Fasthiking Mt Elbert from being at sea level,"Hello all,

I wanted to know the safety concerns of hiking at high altitude. I want to try and tackle my first 14er and heard that Mount Elbert was a good one to start. A bit of a background, I am a very avid trail runner and while I do live somewhere much flatter than Colorado I still get to visit places and run races with tons of vertical gain. The average grade, distance, and ascent of the Mt Elbert summit doesn't scare me, its the altitude of which it starts and ends.

While I do have experience of running in the mountains I have never done anything that starts at 10k feet much less tops out at 14k. The closest I have ever been to that is being only at 10k feet for only about an hour not doing an extraneous work.

Unfortunately, from what I could find, fitness level does not correlate with adjustment to high altitude so I don't really know how my body will respond until I actually attempt to summit.

I can only be there for a max of 4 days then I have to go home. I am assuming I use the first 2-3 days to acclimate then try and summit the last day? 

Any tips and advice? Is Elbert really harder than people make it out to be on the internet or is it fair the amount of difficulty people rate it as?

I have been wanting to do more hiking recently, but I tend to do it infrequently, with long periods of time in between. I do not feel as though I prepare myself enough beforehand, and as a result get muscle fatigue pretty easily.

Are there any tips you could give me on building up my endurance? How do you train yourselves for longer hikes?

Last year, I hiked up Mt Lafayette in the White Mountain ranges of New Hampshire, and after about 3 hours going up I never made it to the top. My legs wouldn't stand the upward elevation any more. I would keep trying to walk up and had to stop after ten seconds every time. I was able to make it down, but the for the next two days my legs were pretty much immobilized by fatigue.

Yesterday I walked around the city of Philadelphia for about three hours just to get back into the habit of moving, and began to feel the same fatigue, with my left leg locking up.

With that in mind, the learning experience company has launched the yearly Mindvalley U program as an innovative alternative.

Providing the vital life lessons that education has forgot and creating a place to grow into your greatness, Mindvalley U combines progressive education with travel and exploration, as each four-week course takes place in a different location—last year’s taking place in Barcelona. The 2018 edition will be in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, a cultural hub for the region, from June 28th–July 22nd.

Instructors will include celebrity memory trainer Jim Kwik, Mindvalley founder and New York Times Best Selling author Vishen Lakhiani, legendary physicist-mystic Nassim Haramein, clinical psychologist and renowned author Shefali Tsabary, WildFit founder Eric Edmeades, Build Great Minds founder Rhea Lalla, nutritionist and hypnotherapist Marisa Peer, Lifebook founders Jon &amp; Missy Butcher, senior Buddhist monk and teacher Gelong Thubten, famed daredevil Wim Hof, who holds 20+ Guinness World Records and will be inviting guests to take an ice bath with him, and much more.

There will also be an opportunity for attendees to work with Mindvalley trainers who will be conducting workshops related to building and running businesses and sharing best practices from within the Mindvalley team, making it the perfect opportunity for digital nomads and entrepreneurs. There will also be networking events, parties, excursions, and the chance to learn more about Estonian culture.

“Mindvalley U and its tribe have had a profound impact in my life,” said former Mindvalley U student Annie Leburn, who was able to join Mindvalley for their debut edition last year in Barcelona. Another former Mindvalley U student Mellisa Foong had this to say about her experience: “Mindvalley U has challenged me both personally and professionally.” By taking into account new emerging trends, Mindvalley U is looking to innovate through these seven aspects of education: the rotating campus, the one-month calendar, the curated community, the accreditation, the cost savings, the upgraded curriculum, and the incredible teachers. Throughout the four-week experience, Mindvalley will bring together a global community of changemakers, leaders, cultural creatives and passionate entrepreneurs from over 50 countries in Tallinn; a city which has the highest number of startups per capita in Europe and is considered the Silicon Valley of the continent. Mindvalley U is also open to kids and teens, offering unique programs curated to propel growing minds towards a progressive and creative educational trajectory.

Applications for Mindvalley U in Estonia are now open. For more information on the event or to apply, please visit the Mindvalley U website. Space is limited and guests are encouraged to apply early.

# Introduction

Adventures are unpredictable by definition. However, careful planning is the key to having a safer, and more enjoyable hiking trip. Whether for an overnight trip or a multi-week journey, you will reap the greatest rewards by preparing for your adventure.Experienced hikers know very well that “Failing to plan is planning to fail”. In its simplest form, planning means packing your gear and setting off with no prescribed route or goal in mind. This is what you can sometimes do in areas you know well, especially when the weather might affect any route plans you made. You can even do that in areas you’ve never visited before, especially if you have an affinity for the unpredictable. However, a reasonable hiker prefers to plan his trip, including the route and his timing; know the potential hazards; check the weather forecast (if you start planning your trip weeks or months in advance, you can use historical temperature data and base your decisions on it), water availability and sources, terrain features, vegetation and wildlife and dangers related to them; select proper and tested equipment, including comfortable hiking footwear, clothing, and gear; and consider all other small details that can turn an adventure into a disaster.The most important questions you should answer are the following:

* **Who will be joining you?**
* **Where will you go?**
* **When will you go?**

These are the main questions you need to answer during the planning stage of your hiking adventure. This will allow you to fine-tune your gear and food selection, develop a realistic timeline, and anticipate potential problems.Partnering up is easy if your soul mate also enjoys backpacking and has a similar level of fitness. But it gets more complicated if your physical preparation level isn’t similar or you have different goals. You need to sort out potential issues in advance and relinquish unrealistic expectations.

# Evaluate your experience, skills, and knowledge. What are your goals?

Pick realistic goals, and save the ambitious projects for when you have the experience and fitness to pull them off. Especially before doing a long hiking trip, it is wise to do a couple of day hikes or two-day trips to evaluate your fitness, your hiking shoes or boots, your gear (hiking pants, shirt, rain jacket, sleeping bag etc.), and your partners. A big trip may quickly be cut short by a pair of ill-fitting boots or bad physical condition.Many backpackers dream of hiking a long-distance trail in one continuous journey which is a major undertaking. Sometimes, people set off on one of these with just a hazy idea of the route yet they complete the whole trail. But far more give up within the first few days or weeks - and this includes those who do some planning. There are various reasons for failure. Heavy packs (full of irrelevant things), sore feet, exhaustion, unexpected weather, rough terrain, and trail conditions are among the most common. Detailed planning is advisable for a long-distance hike, especially one that will take several weeks. A gradual progression should precede a really long trip. First, try hiking shorter but still challenging trails, and then you will have enough knowledge and determination to finish a long walk.Preparation for a long trek means dealing with logistics, picking proper footwear and gear, knowing the specific hazards related to the trail you’ve chosen. Thus, preparation can be one of the most challenging parts of the whole hiking experience yet it’s very important that you not only prepare for your trip but you do it properly.The first step in planning ahead is choosing a trip that is appropriate for your skill level. Too often people get into trouble because they underestimate the challenge of their route or overestimate their individual capabilities. You need to be realistic about how the demands of the trip you are considering align with the reality of your physical ability. For more info on the features of good hikers, you can read our post here.

# Select an area

You can do that with some help from the Internet, guidebooks, maps, magazine articles, hiking blogs, local outing clubs, and guides and outfitters. First, of course, you have to decide where you want to start and finish. Most people have their own preferences based on the nature of the terrain, great stories they’ve read or heard, even on some stunning pictures and photos. Once you have chosen your partner(s) or decided to solo hike, pull out the guidebooks and pick a trail. In addition to trail descriptions, better guidebooks will include time estimates, elevation gain and loss, and warnings about less-obvious hazards. This way you’ll get some valuable preliminary information. If you are going into less-traveled areas, you may have to glean this information from Internet blogs or topographic maps. A Web search with Google is a good place to start. Once you’ve selected an area, you can obtain up-to-date information from the land managers, fellow hikers, Internet or state/local agencies and institutions.

# Obtain up-to-date information

* **Weather and average temperatures** Part of your research should include prevailing weather patterns for your destination. As mentioned above, you can first examine historical temperature data and base your decisions on it. As your departure date gets closer, start following the weather on the Internet - get the most reliable and comprehensive weather forecasts. Nowadays, forecasts can be extremely punctual especially for 4-5 days ahead (specialists reliably predict the weather up to seven days in advance, though keep in mind that this might not be relevant for the mountain weather) and getting caught unprepared is foolish.
* **Daylight** How many hours of daylight do you expect? If there will be night hiking, you’ll need lighting (a headlamp or a flashlight) and warmer clothes. On summer trips, there is enough daylight for up to 14-16 hours of hiking per day. This means that you need only a low-powered headlamp/flashlight for camp chores unless you decide to go on a night hike. Additionally, you don’t need warm clothing to have a good sleep. In contrast, you need a high-powered light for hiking after dark and warmer equipment for your winter hikes.
* **Sun exposure** As we mentioned in our post about summer hiking, sunburn is easier to prevent than treat. Keep in mind that direct solar radiation can be very dangerous, especially between 10 am and 2 pm. The amount of sun exposure is a function of various factors such as cloud cover, vegetation, elevation, surface reflectivity, and the strength of the sun. These details can be obtained from different sources.
* **Terrain (including elevation gain and loss)** The terrain is among the most important factors when choosing proper hiking footwear for your trip. For rough and rocky terrain (especially if you go uphill) you can play it safe and pick up hard-wearing hiking or backpacking boots. They offer better ankle support, more control, and stability in comparison with light low-cut shoes such as trail-running shoes or standard hiking shoes. However, they’re too heavy and need to be broken-in before your hike; otherwise, they can ruin your hiking trip. Additionally, trail-running shoes today are lightweight, more durable and reliable (than before) and provide enough comfort on most kinds of surfaces. Your clothing also relies very much on the terrain you choose for your hiking trip. If trail quality, signage, and maintenance are poor, you need to bring better navigational aids and more protective clothing. You can get familiar with your planned route by looking at pictures and reading descriptions of it.
* **Time estimates** If you don’t have experience with mountain trekking, you will be surprised that going uphill can take so much more time than hiking on even terrain. But it’s true and you need to take that into consideration when planning and estimating your timing.
* **Hazards** Do your research and make sure you know what kind of hazards you may encounter during your trip. Check out our post on hiking hazards and you’ll be much better prepared for a wide range of hiking hazards. Remember that preparing for a disaster does not mean that you can always avoid it; however, you’ll have a much better chance at dealing with almost any extreme situation you encounter on the trail. If you are a novice to the outdoors read our post about the essentials for beginning backpackers here. Anyway, the outdoors is not as dangerous as typically portrayed by sensationalist media stoking fear of the unknown. Nonetheless, people do get sick and injured out there, sometimes fatally. Natural hazards include unpredictable mountain weather, technical rock faces, rockfalls, crevasses, contaminated backcountry water sources, river crossings, flash floods, wildfires, and avalanches.
* **Vegetation** It can be among the last things most backpackers check out when planning their trip, but don’t be fooled by that fact - knowing what kind of vegetation it’s not the same to hike in an arid area with a few cactuses and crossing thick forests (with thorn bushes) or fields lush with grass. For information about vegetation density and types, check topo maps, analyze satellite imagery, find pictures and descriptions posted online.
* **Wildlife and insects** Use blogs and forums to find relevant information about the wildlife and insects that can be a concern. The possible presence of dangerous animals (mice, raccoons, bears, and snakes etc.) affects how and whether you store and protect your food, where you cook and camp, where and when you walk (avoid night hiking in snake country), and whether you need to carry anything for self-defense. Relentless swarms of mosquitoes, black flies, and no-see-ums can completely ruin a trip. There are so many potentially dangerous animals for a hiker so you need to be well-informed in advance about the dangers related to wildlife on a particular hiking trail.
* **Remoteness** Depending on the location, you need to carry one or more of the following: mobile phone in a shock and waterproof case, GPS, personal locator beacon (PLB). If something unexpected happens or if something goes wrong you may need to self-rescue, await an assisted rescue, or apply medical treatment.
* **Water availability** On any walk, you need to know where water sources are and what the condition of the water is likely to be. Water supply is among the most important things you want to know about a region you’ll be hiking in. Having an access to enough drinking water should be one of the major considerations in planning your hiking trip. There are some places where water sources are generally reliable and others where many water sources dry up during the arid summer months. Before relying on a water source marked on a map, consult someone who has personal familiarity with the landscape or check guidebooks and online trip reports for past observations.
* **Precipitation** Your footwear, clothing (including hiking pants, shirt, a fleece, soft shell or an insulated jacket), shelter, the types of materials you use, and water availability will all be affected by the amount and frequency of precipitation you can expect during a trip. In prolonged rainy weather, waterproof shoes or boots won’t protect your feet from getting wet – actually, in such kind of weather you’d better bet on a pair of lightweight trail-running shoes since they’re breathable and will get dry much faster than a pair of boots.

# Sorting the obtained information – what’s useful and what’s irrelevant?

It doesn’t matter how much information you have. It’s important to have enough relevant information. The Internet can overwhelm you with a massive amount of information, so you will need to sort out what’s useful from what’s irrelevant. Many Web sites are updated regularly and provide a ton of (both relevant and irrelevant) information for your hiking trip. Up-to-date local knowledge is still important. Especially in remote areas, locals can be an invaluable source of information.

# Plan routes

Most beginning backpackers usually stick to trails or established routes and limit the amount of off-trail hiking into the wilderness. But even if you plan to be on a trail all day, look carefully at the map before you set off and identify some landmarks to keep track of your progress.First, pinpoint your starting location. Then, trace your planned route carefully making note of key features you will pass on the way. It is a good idea to hike with a map in an easily accessible pocket to consult it if necessary.

# Main problems to solve for long hiking trips

* **Resupplying/logistics** You need to organize the effective supply of enough food for your entire hiking trip. Planning and successfully executing a strategy for resupply is a must for long-distance hikers. You should also know in advance where grocery stores and post offices are located on the trail. Additionally, there are companies that ship resupply packages to hikers on some of the most popular trails (valid for the US).
* **Permits** Many national parks throughout the world require permits. There are places where you need to apply for a permit long before your trip - especially if the place is popular among backpackers and the number of permits is restricted. Thus, it’s best to check whether permits are needed before making firm plans for an area.
* **Hiking footwear, clothing, and gear** (including sleeping bag and pad, tent etc.) Proper equipment is critical to navigating through and living comfortably in the outdoors. Many backcountry emergencies result from people being poorly equipped to meet conditions. You will need appropriate and comfortable hiking footwear that’s durable, fits well, provides excellent traction and control. As far as clothing is concerned, layering is essential, especially when hiking in the mountains. For higher temperatures, pick up a pair of lightweight and breathable hiking shoes or trail-running shoes. For lower temperatures and rough terrain, choose high-cut boots that provide ankle support and give you more control and stability. Pick up a pair of proper hiking pants or shorts depending on the weather, your preferences, and last but not least – the presence or absence of mosquitos, black flies, and other insects. Pretty much the same is valid when choosing a shirt or T-shirt for hiking. For more information about hiking clothing, you can read our blog post here.
* **Know your gear** It doesn’t help to have all the right gear in your backpack if you can’t operate it. Take time to learn how to use your equipment before you leave home. Avoid going out on long trips to isolated places with untried gear. If you are using old gear, pull it out of storage and check to make sure it is in good repair before leaving. Carry a repair kit to fix your gear if something breaks down.
* **Specific problems related to the trail you’ve chosen** Anything that can be of interest from natural hazards to dangerous wildlife and fierce bugs.

# Hiking around the world

Hiking in a foreign country makes planning even more complicated because in addition to applying for a permit, you’ll have to have a valid passport, go to the embassy and apply for a visa (if you go to a country like Nepal), buy a plane ticket, arrange travel insurance, and be vaccinated against tropical diseases such as malaria, leishmaniasis, Trypanosoma etc. (if you go to a tropical country). There’s usually some seasonality and it might be more convenient to visit a place popular for summer trekking, for example, off-season when there aren't so much buzz and hiking enthusiasts around.

# Emergency planning

Emergency planning ensures that you are prepared for the unexpected, that people know where and when to look for you, and that your actions are rational and predictable in spite of the emotional trauma associated with any kind of emergency situation. A contingency plan should lessen the risks involved and increase the probability of being found in case of an emergency situation. Creating an emergency plan and leaving it with friends or family means safer hiking trip for you, fewer headaches and less unnecessary panic for your family (and friends). Additionally, carry a first aid kit in an outer container made of durable nylon to protect contents. Among the essentials in your first aid kit, you should include some analgesics/antibiotics/anaphylaxis (Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Sting relief pad etc.), bandages, antiseptic towelettes, blister care pads, gauze sponges, safety whistle, water-purifying tablets, extra shoelaces, fire starter, duct tape, multi-purpose tool. Anyway, its exact content depends on the features of the place you will go for a hike, the chronic diseases you have, and your previous experience.   

# Meal planning

Planning meals is an essential part of planning a hiking trip. You need to eat regularly throughout your hike. Having three solid meals a day with a snack or two in between is recommended. Food plays a large part in how much you enjoy the outdoors. You’ll need lightweight, non-perishable, high in calories foods that taste good. Exhaustion after a long day on the trail can make you think about skipping your dinner which isn’t good for your health and fitness; however, knowing that you have some tasty food in your pack can make you change your mind. A warm and tasty dinner can not only make you feel better but also boost your morale. In our post about packing for a multi-day hiking trip we mentioned that a 90 kg person burns around 550 calories per hour of hiking (it usually varies between 450 and 650 depending on the terrain, weather, your fitness etc.). Thus, you’ll need a lot of energy on the trail. So when planning your meals, look for foods rich in carbs, fats, and sugar - such kind of foods will provide you enough energy for a long hiking day.    

# Planning and packing your backpack

When packing your backpack before hitting the trail, the little things can add up to make a big difference later. If you start out with a good organization system, life in the backcountry will be simpler and more pleasant. Plan carefully the contents of your hiking pack considering the duration of your trip, the expected weather and temperatures, the features of the terrain, the potential dangers on the trail, and your specific needs.Do the packing the day(s) before the hike when you are not in a rush. Lots of novice hikers try to pack in the morning of the hike and as a result forget some important things like toilet paper, flashlight, fire starter, raincoat etc. It can be daunting to pack for your first wilderness adventure and you don’t want to exacerbate things further by doing it in a rush. Make detailed lists, and note what you do and do not use so that on future trips you can fine-tune the packing. Eliminate redundancy when pack planning. When deciding what to cut, think twice about eliminating insulation and food. A fleece or a sweater doesn’t weigh a lot and won’t slow you down significantly but can be very useful on the trail. It helps to have things you will need during the day near the top of your pack. Keep things like spare clothes and food there for an easy access without having to unpack other gear. Carry snacks in hip belt pockets and have your water bottle located so you can reach it without removing your pack. You can check out our posts about packing for a day-hike and packing for a multi-day hike. You will find some further recommendations on packing there as well as lists with basic and extra stuff essential for a hiking trip.

# Conclusion

Planning a hike, whether for a weekend or a summer, takes time and energy, and the adventure itself can vanish in a welter of lists, logistics, maps, and food. Detailed planning is advisable for any hike, especially for a long-distance hiking trip that will take several weeks or months. Planning such a walk can be difficult, however. Sometimes, the process of planning your hiking trip can be more daunting than the hiking itself. Remember that compiling information takes time, and there are always gaps - you can’t avoid that. However, this shouldn’t discourage you because as soon as you take that first step into the wilderness, all the organization fades into the background. Then it’s just you and nature.Trekking, like any other activity, is usually more successful if the participants are ready and if they have some idea of what to expect. So be ready to meet the challenges, be prepared to be flexible and to make the best of all circumstances. ",hiking,1530734645,Camotrek,0,1,True,2018-07-04
53,Anyone have advice on hiking in sandals and good brands for women?,"Long story short, I had a scare a few months ago when I got heat exhaustion while camping and hiking. It was highly recommended that I change up my gear, including my footwear. I have always hiked in waterproof, ankle-height boots to this point, but it’s going to be 90+ degrees on every day of my trip this weekend and I’m seriously considering looking at sandals instead. 

I hate Chacos, but they’re the first brand that comes to mind as an active sandal. Does anyone have thoughts on Chacos, other good hiking sandals, or have advice on wearing sandals for hikes? 

As a note: they’ll be used for day hikes from 1-13 Miles and weekend camping trips. I’ll still be using my boots for anything intense, just looking for another option that would keep my feet cooler in hot weather. ",hiking,1530742414,livinandlearnin16,4,1,True,2018-07-04

63,Replacing Keens for creek hikes,"I have an old pair of Keens, (don't remember which ones, but they look similar to Newport H2), which are on their last legs. I use them for hikes where I'll be spending much of the day in the water, i.e. hiking up a stream. I also wear them on shorter hikes.

I liked that they were lightweight, and the toe protection. Downsides were that despite them being sandals, the material would take forever to dry out. Also, because they are not enclosed with mesh, you can get debris in them.

I've been considering a couple of options:

1) A trail runner, though most seem to have too much heel padding. For creek hikes, I want something more pliable.

2) Another pair of Keens, or similar sandal. Any other recs?

3) Crocs, or some other rubber shoe with a heel strap

77,"NEW on KICKSTARTER: CuloClean, the most portable bidet in the market","Hi!

This is Ana and Guillermo, two young engineers from Madrid (Spain) **concerned about the environment** and willing to offer an **efficient, reusable, discreet and cheap solution to everyone's intimate hygiene**.

We have been wondering why we use water for washing our bodies but we use paper for our intimate hygiene. Paper result is not perfect, and **the ""just showered"" feeling is priceless**. 

https://i.redd.it/en5au3pph4811.png

So we designed CuloClean for ourselves and later we though it could be a great idea to sell it too. Why?

**because it's efficient**

A small water bottle is enough to get perfect results. You can regulate the intensity of the flow by exerting more or less pressure with your hand. Squeeze it harder and you will have a better result using less water and time.

https://i.redd.it/noz1iepph4811.png

**because it's compatible with most plastic bottles in the world**

You don't need a specific bottle (brand or size) to use it. Just use any beverage plastic bottle you already have, refill it with tap water, insert CuloClean in it and... squeeze it till you are clean!

https://i.redd.it/joy66fpph4811.png

**because it's discreet**

You can keep it in your pocket. No one will figure out what you are about to do. It will look like you are heading to the washroom just to refill your bottle with water.

https://i.redd.it/7go7cfpph4811.png

**because the more CuloClean in the world, the less waste is generated**

No more wet wipes. No more programmed obsolescence. CuloClean is durable. 

During the month of July we are going to be **on Kickstarter with very special offers**. We really want to spread this to the whole world because we think that it's a good solution for everyone's intimate hygiene and for the environment.

14,Minnear - Rough terrain area,"Minnea what? Minnear rough terrain area is a completely undeveloped area east of San Jose, CA. There are no improvements all all - no trails, no facilities, no nothing except a dirt pullout off the road.

What's the allure? The challenge, of course! The advantage of a rough terrain area is no trails, so you can go wherever you want. The disadvantage of a rough terrain area is no trails, so every step has to be planned in advance.

Most hiking is along a trail, and often has no great mental effort. Step after step, follow the trail. But when there's no trail, the mental effort is as extreme as the physical. Going along a partial cow path on the side of a steep hill takes concentration!

I recently moved to an area that has quite a bit of hiking trails (deserty type areas no fallen trees and rocks to maneuver around or through), and considering I'm fat and out of shape, that I would start going on short hikes, nothing too long to start maybe 3-ish miles.  Like I said I'm fat and I need a good pair of shoes. I don't have too much money to spend so I would like to see if anyone could recommend a good pair of shoes to buy. They have to be under $100,  way under. I know that you get what you pay for but are there any shoes on the  low end of the spectrum that are actually good considering the low price? Also I usually buy those shoe inserts to replace the ones in  my shoes because they help my foot pain.  Is it a good idea to replace the inserts or are the ones that come with them better because they were designed to work with the new shoes? Please, I really do appreciate any advice  you  all may provide.

I’m traveling light (40L pack) so I don’t want to bring heavy hiking boots/shoes. I’m looking for something hybrid (if that exists); low-key and versatile so they can double as shoes to walk around town, but have sufficient traction and stability for hiking. I’ve been looking mostly at trail running shoes, which I’ve learned some hikers prefer to traditional hiking footwear. The climate in SE Asia is hot/humid, and i’ll be there during the rainy season, so I’m also debating whether I should go waterproof or breathable. From what I understand (and have been previously recommended), waterproof-lined shoes will get hot, which is not ideal for a climate like Thailand. But then again breathable could mean wet feet if it rains while I’m out.

I'm considering shoes around $120, but would prefer something lower. Here are some pairs I’m considering:

* Adidas Supernova GTX (regular runners with an “all-terrain” outsole) - https://www.adidas.com/us/supernova-gtx-shoes/BB3669.html
* Adidas Response Trail (these seem the most versatile imo. Not waterproof, but have a “seam-free waterline” for some protection in wet conditions) - https://www.adidas.com/us/response-trail-shoes/CG4011.html

7,FIVE GOLDEN RULES FOR SUMMER HIKING,"    All comments and recommendations are welcome! 

# Introduction

The summertime is a popular time for most people to see some of the natural wonders. Unfortunately, many of these places are located in remote areas that experience intense heat.

Three main factors affect hikers in hot environments: temperature, humidity, and direct solar radiation. In response, the human body uses several mechanisms to stay comfortable in hot conditions.

The human body attempts to maintain a core body temperature between 36.5 and 37.5°C. Maintaining the temperature within this range is essential for the proper bodily function of human organs. Heat is produced in the body by normal metabolism, exercise, and shivering. When your muscles contract while you are hiking, they generate heat. When heat must be dispersed, the cardiovascular system stimulates more blood flow to the skin (causing a red or flushed look when exercising hard) and less blood flow to abdominal organs by increasing the heart rate and cardiac output. Respirations increase and result in evaporative cooling from the lungs.

As the outside temperature increases, getting closer to your body’s core temperature, this method of getting rid of extra heat is less effective. Another physiological response is sweating. In dry environments, your sweat evaporates, cooling the surface of the skin. However, in climates with high humidity, sweat does not evaporate, leaving you feeling hot and damp.

Many hikers don’t know all the things to take into account when hiking in a hot summer. Hiking safety isn’t one of the first things that people think of when they go on a hike, but it should be their priority.

# Rule 1: Stay hydrated

Ambient temperature, elevation, exercise intensity, and duration increase the physiological strain, calorie and water demands on your body. This makes summer hiking more difficult than traveling the same distance in cooler temperatures.

Fluid/electrolyte loss can reach up to 1.5-2 liters per hour if you hike uphill in direct sunlight and during the hottest time of the day. When you hike in a place where the air is hot and dry, sweat evaporates instantly, making its loss almost imperceptible.

Dehydration causes blood vessels in the skin to constrict and limit sweat production. Waiting to feel significantly thirsty is a poor strategy since thirst is indicative of early dehydration. On the other hand, episodes of exercise-associated hyponatremia (EAH) have occurred because people forced themselves to drink unnecessarily to meet a fluid goal. Fluids should be cool beverages containing a maximum of 6&amp;#37; carbohydrates. A higher concentration of sugar delays gastric emptying, and when the solution is cool, the body absorbs it more easily. Salt can be replaced through fluids or dietary intake.

Even a mild level of dehydration can turn the joy of hiking into an unpleasant experience. The more dehydrated you become, the less efficient your body is at self-cooling. This puts you at greater risk for heat-related illness. Over-hydration and lack of salty foods can also be very dangerous, as this may lead to a condition called hyponatremia.

Hyponatremia usually occurs for individuals in a high heat environment who have overhydrated with water while not also eating. Avoiding overhydration is the primary strategy to prevent EAH. Eating and drinking moderately throughout the day and using rehydration tabs or mixes are good methods to prevent hyponatremia while providing the body with the needed nutrients to fuel a day of hiking.

Avoid consuming plain water and encourage consumption of salty foods as long as there is no neurological deficit or risk of aspiration. A treatment paradox is that EAH and dehydration may present similarly, but require opposite treatment: hydration for dehydration but fluid restriction for EAH. 

When homeostasis is not maintained, mild to fatal heat illness can occur. Assessing the environment for heat illness risks is essential for successful hiking in hot environments.

# Rule 2: Choose appropriate clothing

Your choice of clothing for hiking in hot weather will depend on the region of the country and the time of year. You need to choose very carefully your clothing before you set off for a hike in hot weather because hiking in the heat will increase perspiration.

In very hot weather, choose lightweight, loose-fitting, light-colored long-sleeved clothing for ventilation and heat reflection. The material should be breathable and have water-wicking properties that aid in evaporative cooling. Wear synthetic clothing which will wick the sweat from your body and dry quickly. You should also consider what accessories you are wearing as well. Wear sunscreen and a hat if you are out in the sun in a place where there is little tree cover as they will provide proper protection against potentially harmful UV rays. A bandana around the neck can be helpful too.

Your first inclination may be to wear shorts and a short-sleeve shirt, and in many places, this may indeed be excellent. Many hikers prefer to wear convertible pants with legs that zip off to become shorts. You can read our post about the pros and cons of convertible pants and shorts [here](https://www.camotrek.com/blogs/news/convertible-pants-or-shorts-for-summer-hiking).

While tempting, cotton T-shirts are not recommended for backpacking (except in desert climes) because they get soaked with sweat and chafe your skin. For greater comfort, select a loose-fitting T-shirt made from polyester. It offers good airflow and fast drying while protecting your shoulders from the sun.

In areas where ticks, mosquitoes, and black flies are a problem, your best option is to wear long clothing, tuck your pants into your socks, wear light colors so you can see ticks more easily, and even wear a head net if the bugs are really bad. You might also consider treating your hiking clothes with permethrin.

# Rule 3: Cover up

Clothing and shade are behavioral actions that complement the body’s internal heat regulation mechanisms, but environmental variables such as air temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and radiation have the greatest impact on heat exchange.

Ultraviolet radiation can cause common sunburn. The energy in solar radiation encompasses wavelengths measured in nanometers (nm). Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is divided into UVA, UVB, and UVC, with wavelengths of 315 to 400 nm, 280 to 315 nm, and 100 to 280 nm, respectively. UVA and UVB rays are of the most concern, as UVC is mostly absorbed by the ozone in the Earth’s atmosphere. Sixty-five percent of UVR reaches the Earth’s surface in the middle of the day, between 10 am and 2 pm.

Sunburn is easier to prevent than treat. Limiting the chance of burning involves avoiding excessive UVR, especially exposure between 10 am and 4 pm, covering up with tightly woven clothing, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, wearing sunglasses, seeking shade, and using proper sunscreen with frequent applications. Dark-colored fabrics are more protective than lighter or white fabric.

Sunburn is the result of excessive UVR exposure, which can be mild to severe. Mild sunburn consists of local heat, red skin, and pain. Severe sunburn may include swelling, itchiness, blister formation, malaise, weakness, fatigue, nausea, chills, fever, and headache.

Once a sunburn has developed there are no effective treatments, only measures that can reduce the discomfort. Medications for pain and decreasing inflammation can help, along with cooling the area with a damp cloth or cold compresses. Alternatives such as aloe vera, oatmeal, or baking soda are anecdotal and may provide some relief but have not been scientifically proven. Medical attention may be required for severe sunburns.

# Rule 4: Avoid midday hiking

Avoid hiking in the hottest part of the day (mid-afternoon), go at a slow pace, rest frequently, and take sips of water every 15 minutes or so.

If you want to have a safe and enjoyable hiking trip, you need good timing to avoid the heat. You need to be very careful and limit your exposure to the direct sunlight. Hike in cooler weather - early in the morning, late in the afternoon, in the evening, and at night.

Plan your day so you are not hiking between the hours of 10 am and 4 pm. A great way to avoid the heat is to start walking early. It’s cooler in the mornings and the temperature will be more comfortable to hike in. Late afternoons and evenings are also more suitable for summer hiking. Always bring a flashlight or a headlamp to give yourself the option of hiking out after dark if something slows you down or you choose to continue walking after dusk.

# Rule 5: Cool regularly and rest

Taking regular breaks will help to ensure you don’t become dehydrated. Give your body enough time to recover without wasting your energy in the heat. Try to find a shaded area to get out of the sun. Remembering to stop and take a break allows you to enjoy the experience of being out on the trails much more.

Active cooling methods should be administered. Whenever you reach near water, keep yourself wet. This will not only cool yourself but also make a wonderful difference in how well you feel, especially at the end of the day. Eventually, it will help decrease your core body temperature. Additionally, dip your bandana in water when you are really hot and it can make you feel cooler. If you are wearing a hat also dip it in water periodically.

# Conclusion

The inability to stay cool and hydrated may be fatal while hiking in hot temperatures. To prevent dehydration, heat stress, sunstroke, and sunburn, you must be able to keep yourself cool, hydrated, and sun-screened or skin-covered. Wear appropriate and breathable hiking clothing, including shorts or convertible pants (or regular hiking pants), loose-fitting and light-colored hiking shirt or T-shirt, wool/synthetic socks, hat, and bandana. Don’t forget your sunglasses too.

Start your hike early in the morning and avoid midday hiking. Take a break near shade and water to avoid the worst heat of the day. Have plenty of rest and cool regularly.

If you follow these five rules, your summer hiking trips will be safer and more enjoyable.",hiking,1529102073,Camotrek,1,1,True,2018-06-15

They said my muscles slow down and tense up every break I take. Were they right? Was stopping for a brief period of time every half an hour doing me harm when I was clearly not doin so hot? I feel like for them going without stopping did them good as they are in better shape than I am, but for me who was clearly having a difficult time, it would be a different story.

6,Best day hikes in America?,"Sup r/hiking

I didn't see a FAQ or any other threads related to this topic. Mods delete if unallowed.

Looking for recommendations for the best day hikes in the US. Looking to make a couple weekend trips this Summer and hike more. Camping, repelling, and any sort of climbing which requires rigging/equipment aren't options because I don't own any gear and I'm trying to travel light. So, for now, I'm only looking for hikes that can be completed in 10hrs or less with standard hiking and day pack type stuff.

I'd classify myself as an amateur hiker. I haven't done many hikes so I can't say I'm novice, and definitely not experienced. I'm a relatively fit young male adult, 25\-30 years old, although my cardio could use improvement. I did the Kuliouou Ridge Trail in Hawaii earlier this year which is a 4mi, 1600ft elevation, out and back hike in about 4hrs (I got a late start so I had to rush through it to get to the top). I also did a couple other hikes in the same weekend which is what got me in love with hiking and seeing/exploring more of nature.

I know there are websites/apps like AllTrails and TheLonelyPlanet, plus the entire wealth of collective knowledge called the internet, but its almost too much information. Its overwhelming. There are too many options and places that I'd like to go that I'm unable to commit to just one to start. That's why I'm coming to you.

I enjoy elevation gain hikes with rewarding scenic views more than anything. So, with all that in mind, if you could recommend just one place in America to complete a day hike, where would you go?",hiking,1528932034,dcw242,7,1,True,2018-06-13

First off is shoes,
I’m planning on going with my family so we’re not going to be doing anything crazy. I’m planning on getting some timberland trail mix sneakers for added support and comfort. I know there are better options for support but I have to pack very light and I could wear these just as casually as any other shoes. 

Second is pants, 
Right now I have jeans and athletic sweatpants, like I said we’re not staying overnight or anything, probably just going to be out for 4-5 hours max so I was wondering if these would still work. Obviously synthetic pants would be the best option so if there are any recommendation that would be helpful.

My doctor has started to speculate that it could be a reaction to me staying in my hiking/exercise clothes too long. I hike 3-4 times a week and try to get in one 10+ mile hike a week while my others are 6-8 miles. I usually hike in yoga pants sans panties because I have found that cotton panties aren’t wicking and lead to entirely too much chafing. 

Can you recommend a ladies panty that is comfortable for long hikes, wicks moisture and does not cause chafing?

32,Bunkotel’s guide to overcoming homesickness,"Travelling has become cool, trendy and fun but can be a daunting task in just one snap of a finger. Going out of your shell is fine but its sometimes leads to sadness and homesickness. Here is [Bunkotel](https://bunkotel.in/) Mussoorie’s guide, to overcome homesickness.

**Pack some of your favourite pics**

Going digital is all fine but somehow you want to hold on to some tangible memory. What better way to hold it in your hands. When you travel, keep a picture of your close family, pets or loved ones close. If you feel sad, just hold that picture in your hands. Remember that how many stories you will share with them when you will be back. 

**Everyone loves his/her favourite thing**

Every one of us have some product which we swear by and under no circumstance, we will let them go. Take you that blanket, shawl, sweater, slippers, t\-shirt or that trinket along with you. It makes you feel home even if you are in the middle of a desert or high in the [mountains](https://bunkotel.in/).

**Try to stick to your daily habits** 

Sticking to your daily routine will let you alleviate that feeling of homesickness. This can include daily workout, your usual way of unwinding like music, books or a normal walk.

**Try to buy something for your people**

Although we love minimalism, people love gifts and that facts are as old as time itself. While looking for a gift you are actually reminded of that excitement that you will encounter while you will give that meaningful gifts to the receiver. This will surely cheer you up.

**Make that call, back home**

Going to a holiday means immersing yourself in having new experiences not cutting off from your regular world. Today with call rates being so cheap and technology like WhatsApp call handy, you can literally make that call for free. Connect and engage with your loved ones like every day and you will actually feel that you are in your home. Homesickness can be said bye in a jiffy. You can also connect to social media and feel happy about the likes and praises that you get when you upload your photos and status update. 

**Do the same things that you do in your hometown**

Do you like to visit the local bookstore at your home? Try to find a substitute and visit it. Do you like going out on coffee? Do the same at your holiday. This makes you feel home and let you cope your homesickness.

**Form new friendship** 

Communicating and connecting with a new set of people while on a holiday can be a great stress\-buster. Try to talk and share your time while on travel and when the other person also shares the same with you, you get an instant connect and your homesickness goes away. 

**Make a to\-do list** 

When you make a to\-do list you actually have something to do, every hour in that day. This will not let you have spare, free time when you feel homesick. When you have the list you have an immersive experience where you actually live your holidays. 

**Try to travel in a group in a hostel**

When you travel solo, it sometimes can become lonely and you are bound to miss your home and normal routine life and feel homesick. If you travel in a group you are more likely to get busier and more engaged. Try to stay in a hostel where you can all stay in one room and share. Bunkotel in [Mussoorie](https://bunkotel.in/) is one such ideal place. ",hiking,1528782939,bunkotel,0,1,True,2018-06-12

My friend has coped fine, although I am the one who gets regular exercise, but each walk I have done, towards the end, I get nauseous and headachey and I feel a bit weak and it ruins my enjoyment. I've put this down to mild heatstroke because I can't think of another reason (although I'm certainly nowhere near dangerous levels of heatstroke).

I'm wearing appropriate clothing, drinking *lots*, sweating fine, eating enough, wearing sunglasses....still I end up feeling unwell. I just looked it up and found out the antidepressants I take increase your risk of overexposure to the sun because they change the way your body regulates heat, so perhaps this is why I'm so sensitive.

I'm basically asking is there anything more I could do to try and rid myself of these symptoms because I'm really enjoying the walking! Or is it the case my body will get used to it over time?",hiking,1528573004,reallybigleg,8,1,True,2018-06-09

5,7 FEATURES OF A GOOD HIKER,"     All comments, remarks, and recommendations are welcome.  

Every year, first\-time hikers set off along the trail unfit, ill\-equipped, and with unrealistic expectations. However, you needn't be a beginner hiker to make silly mistakes on the trail. So, what features are typical of good hikers?

# Well-prepared physically

A good hiker knows that being in good physical condition is of prime importance when he hits the trail. The best training for hiking is hiking regularly, i.e. the best way to train for carrying heavy loads over rough terrain is to carry heavy loads over rough terrain. Although this isn‘t always practical, you‘d be surprised what you can do if you really want to, even if you live and work in a city. If you want to be in a good physical shape for trekking, you need to go for day hikes regularly. Try to hike even when the weather is inclement. You can gain a double benefit of training in such conditions \- it helps you to get used to all sorts of weather on the one side and it makes you tougher on the other side. Additionally, this way you learn more about yourself, your reactions, and your body’s behavior. You don’t need any special equipment for short hikes of 2\-4 hours so not having the latest lightweight hiking shoes, hi\-tech jacket or pack is no justification for staying home and not hitting the trail. With time, you’ll get more experience and will learn that training on difficult terrain in adverse weather conditions will be very beneficial, especially when you are on a long trail experiencing bad weather and/or having to tackle rough terrain. At the very least, spend a few weekends getting used to walking with a load before setting off on a longer trip. You need aerobic, or cardiovascular, fitness to walk and climb all day without having your heart pound and your lungs gasp for air. Without muscular fitness, particularly of the legs, you‘ll be stiff and aching all over on the second day out. Also, if you set out unfit, you‘re much more susceptible to strains and muscle tears. Getting fit takes time and good hikers know it. Keep in mind that resting after training is important and the chances that you get an injury is lower if you manage to recover well before your next training.

# Applied knowledge and desire to learn

There is one common feature of most successful people in almost any field and it is the desire to learn and become better at what they do. Hiking is no different. Learning is a simple process which takes time and patience. A self\-directed learning process is arguably the most powerful model for facilitating and inspiring individual, group and organizational learning and development. For example, according to professionals from Princeton, the learning process is based on three major principles. They define the first one the following way: “Identification of gaps between one’s IDEAL self and REAL self. These gaps represent a primary motivator to learn and improve.” So knowing your weaknesses will help you create a realistic action plan for development. Read books and articles on hiking, ask more experienced hikers than you, learn and test what works for you and what doesn’t. It’s true that experience is the best teacher; however, this doesn’t mean that you shouldn't prepare yourself (at least theoretically) for the challenges of the wilderness.

# Tough mentally

You may call it human spirit, will, resilience or another way. So many things can get wrong, especially when you’re on a long trail. Most good hikers know it and they’re mentally prepared to cope with the psychological burden of a long trail, including being hungry, thirsty, cold/hot, wet etc. In the wilderness, mental toughness can be the difference between life and death. In a long trail, even the best hikers have moments when they feel like quitting. However, a good hiker always continues because he knows that the moment would pass.

# Learn from mistakes

A good hiker is able to learn from his own mistakes. When he was still a neophyte hiker, he’s probably overpacked. It happens to so many beginner hikers to get two or three pairs of shoes (waterproof boots, standard hiking shoes, and trail sandals, for example), more clothes or gear than necessary. It’s crucial for a good hiker to have the ability to learn from mistakes – not only from his own mistakes but also from the mistakes of others.

# Resourcefulness, good decision-making, logical thinking

As we have already outlined in our post '7 Common Mistakes the Beginner Hikers Make', hiking is about problem\-solving, and problem\-solving requires sound logic. Some of the most serious mistakes on the trail stem from an improper use of logic. Good hikers think logically and it allows them to take better decisions. Resourcefulness helps them find ways of dealing with practical problems on the trail. A general recommendation: Don’t put limitations on yourself. Don’t bet against yourself. And take risk. Taking a well\-calculated risk is justified in most situations not only in hiking but also in life.

# Respect nature; weather

A good hiker respects nature, the land he is moving through, and is not fooled by a sense of superiority. He respects natural powers and knows that he can’t control them. He doesn’t underestimate trail terrain and weather conditions because he knows what can be the consequences of doing that. Especially if hiking solo, a moment of distraction and a slip can lead to a life\-threatening situation when there’s no one to go for help. A good walker must weigh every action carefully and assess every risk.

# Motivation and determination

If someone asks us what’s the single most important thing for being successful at what you do, we’d probably pick motivation. Yes, it’s important to be in a good physical shape, develop a positive mental attitude, be resourceful and think logically, learn from own mistakes and from others’ mistakes, stay humble and respect natural powers. Each and every one of these is a very important feature of any good hiker and there is no doubt about that. However, motivation is the crucial element in setting and attaining goals. It’s a mere fact that most successful people in life are not the toughest, smartest, strongest or the most physically fit ones but those who are determined, motivated, hard\-working, and consistent. Motivation is so powerful, it’s like an engine which gives you energy and strength to keep going, to push harder. It compels you to take action.

Long\-run motivation is usually more important than short\-run motivation because “Rome wasn’t built in a day”. For consistent results, you need to find a way to stay motivated; you need to maintain your motivation for a long time.

One of the most surprising things about motivation is that it often comes *after* starting a new behavior, not before. Motivation is often the result of an action, not the cause of it. Getting started, even in very small ways, is a form of active inspiration that naturally produces momentum. You don't need much motivation once you've started a behavior. Nearly all of the friction in a task is at the beginning. After you start, progress occurs more naturally. In other words, it is often easier to finish a task than it was to start it in the first place. Thus, one of the keys to getting motivated is to make it easy to start.

# Conclusion

﻿﻿﻿Your gear is an important factor in a long hiking trip. The accurate selection, quantity, and knowledge how to correctly use your equipment are essential for your comfort on the trail. All the elements of your hiking gear should be tested prior to a multi\-day hiking trip. You need to adjust hiking clothing so don’t hesitate to experiment and try various combinations to find out what works best for you. While on the trail, you’ll have to deal with various problems so try to eliminate in advance any doubts you may have about your footwear, pack, and clothing. Remember that if your skill level is low, your comfort and safety will depend on the gear you carry on your back, not on the weightless knowledge between your ears. However, if you add some (why not all) of the features we’ve outlined above, your hiking experience will be much safer, more enjoyable, and worth remembering.",hiking,1528410858,Camotrek,5,1,True,2018-06-07

54,Time off from work. Where should I go?,"I have 9 days of from work coming up in a few weeks, and because I'm almost never allowed to take that time off in the summer, I have planned zero things and almost forgot it was coming up. All my hiking/camping pals are busy, so I'm contemplating going somewhere where I can hit some trails. 

My parameters: 

-$1000 or less

-I like day hikes, especially in terrain that doesn't remind me of the somewhat flat, blandness of home. 

-I'm not interested in backpacking overnight alone, but am willing to sleep in my car or at a campground alone. 

-I'm in Michigan. It doesn't have to be within driving distance, but flying somewhere means not being able to sleep in my somewhat duded-out sleep-mobile or my tent, thus probably having to spend money on a hotel. Also, I'd have to rent a car to get to trailheads. 

-I'm open to visiting either just one place or a string of places, though I'm usually a meticulous planner, and having lots of info to keep track of or decide while I'm on the road is somewhat less appealing. 

-I loved the Smokies and Shenandoah. Particularly waterfalls and rock scrambling (though not the serious stuff that requires gear). I liked Zion a lot and very seriously want to go back to Utah to do the big five, but the amount of money I feel like spending will likely keep me on this side of the country. 

-I absolutely cannot go somewhere as grand as Yosemite without my bf, who won't be with me on this trip. He would cry big, sad, elephant tears if either of us did something *that* cool without the other. 

-I'm also open to suggestions that blatantly ignore my parameters, fwiw.

72,Should I keep my new Lowa boots? (sizing advice wanted),"Hello Hiking new poster here.  Please excuse my english, hope you can understand.


 I bought a new pair of LOWA Vantage gtx trekking boots (discontinued so it was a super deal).  I checked Lowa's sizing guide and went for a size 11UK/10US.  The problem is I'm not 100% sure if it is the right fit, and unfortunately trying different sizes in the store is not an option right now for me.

Also,  that is the same size I use on two other brands/models:

Asolo Fugitive (10 UK/10.5 US/44.5 EU)
La Sportiva Nepal (10 UK / 11 US / 44.5 EU)

Adidas street/running shoes:  9.5 UK/ 10 US / 44 EU
Vasque Mantra hiking shoes :  9 UK/ 10 US / 43 EU


They all fit like a glove despite the small differences, and I am particularly in love with the fit of the Nepals in the mountains, never had hot spots, never a had blister, absolutely great.
The Lowa's are listed as  10UK/ 11US / 44.5 EU , just like my Nepals.

Apparently the should fit just like the others, but wearing them at home I feel a tiny bit of heel slippage, and when I compare the insoles, Lowa has bigger ones.  Is this an indicator that I should go for a smaller size?   They don't feel bigger, but not as snug as my Asolo boots.  I'm trying them with mid weight socks (I use thicker ones and silk liners with my Nepals).

Anyone has experience wearing this brand?   thanks a lot

483,Fear of heights.. How do I overcome this?,"I've always loved hiking and have been an outdoors kind of kid, fearless with heights. When I was 13 years old or so I fell down a cliff face. The cliff face was shale and rock.. all hitting my face three times before finally being knocked out before I hit the ground. When I awoke from the fall a few minutes latter I was pinned down under a log half way in the creek and halfway out. I had a broken nose and my face was mangled on the right side in three places by my eye, my nose and my chin. When I got to the hospital a few hours latter they said I was lucky not to loose any teeth and that my braces probably helped keep them in place. Now I was young and stupid, completely inexperienced with proper hiking techniques at the time. I am now 32 years old and much more cautious but I find as I grow older I am increasingly more and more sensitive and afraid of heights. I can't even be on a wide path if there are steep hills or cliffs within a few feet of where I stand. Hiking is something I enjoy and love but I literally have panic attacks if I'm close to an edge or steep hill even if it's safe. How can I overcome this and continue to do something that I love without the shaking of the legs and the feeling of feeling faint and freaking the f***out? Any good advice?

17,Hiking North Face of Grand Canyon with only Hiking Shoes - do I need to get boots?,"Hi everyone,

I am hiking the north face of the grand canyon in a few days. I'm very excited! We are actually going to hike to the bottom on the South side, camp in Phantom Ranch, and then hike up the North side the day after.

My question: I only have hiking *shoes* (without ankle support), not boots, and I wonder if that's enough or if I'm in danger. I am interested in the SAFEST option, and not concerned about price.

- stick with my hiking shoes for now.
- buy brand new hiking boots, which I will have 2 easier hikes to break in before the North Face hike. Not broken in = lots of moleskin for me.
- are there braces (akin to the sleeves that people wear when injured) that I could put on underneath my shoes for ankle stability? Obviously not as good as a full boot, but I'm curious.

Other deets:

- This will probably be one of the more physically grueling tasks I've ever done. I have been training for this by doing stairs with a weighted backpack in my building, I can do 162 flights of stairs (27 stories x 6) with a weighted backpack before gassing out, but we are planning on having a few rest stops.
- I did injure my ankle pretty badly 3 years ago (I was tipsy at 3am carrying a heavy load down stairs, it's complicated). I sometimes feel a little tweakiness in that ankle when doing complicated exercises, but not during my stair training (probably since stairs are easy).

I know this isn't ideal whatsoever, and I deserve derision for screwing up etc., but I appreciate any help you guys can give me.

I have been worrying a lot about the hike recently and whether I am truly ready, so I just wanted to know what I should expect.

I am an 18 year old male who is 6'2 210 lbs. I have been going to the gym for strength training 4 days a week for over a year, and over the past few months I have added in cardio to my routine. I have been doing an hour on the Stairmaster, an hour on the treadmill at a 10&amp;#37; incline, or a mixture of those 2 for the past few months. I have also been on a few 6\-8 mile hikes, a couple of 10 mile hikes, and a hike up Blanca Peak in Colorado where we are hiking for 10\+ hours 2 days in a row and reaching elevations of about 14,000 feet. All of this, I have done with little to no problems.

I seem to be doing OK with what they recommend for the workout, but I am just worried because I still weigh quite a lot. I definitely have some fat around my stomach, and I am not the slimmest person in the world, but my Body Fat Percent is right around 20.5\-21&amp;#37;, and I haven't been seriously hurt by long hikes or altitude in the past.

I've started to exercise in the form of walking, with an ambition of training for hiking. I've been walking for a few hours a day for about two months now.



To up the challenge, I've started to carry 15-25 pounds of weight on a backpack while walking, hoping to simulate some of the weight you might carry hiking. With this weight, I've started to walk about 6-8 miles a day.



Is this safe? I've seen many commentators on this subject say that this is going to mess me up in the long-run, specifically in regard to knees. However, if that was true, how does anybody go hiking? Are they just claiming that hiking is unhealthy? I posted specifically to /r/hiking instead of /r/fitness as they seem to be pretty anti-walking there.

48,Ultimate Gear List For Hiking,"This list is designed for someone starting out brand new. I do suggest borrowing, renting, or buying used whenever possible. This list just lays out the situation where that isn’t an option.

The ‘Big 3’ items are your backpack, shelter, and sleeping bag. They take up the most space/weight and have the biggest impact on comfort. I suggest spending the most money and time on these 3 items. You’ll need to do research, try things on, and drop some change to ensure your trip isn’t ruined by a hurt back or wet/cold night. In the end – we are outdoors for entertainment, not punishment.

In general – TAKE LESS. There are always the safety items that I never go without, including ‘the 10 essentials’. Beginners tend to over-pack. A trip for 1-5 nights in basic 3-season conditions should allow you a pack under 40 pounds. Above 50 and the fun factor goes down drastically. While some experienced hikers get under 20 pounds, that takes more monetary investment and a deeper understanding of what is truly needed for a specific adventure.

You’ll notice I don’t include a big knife, hatchet, or pocket saw. I rarely build fires while backpacking and when I do they are small enough where hand gathering wood is sufficient. This follows LNT guidelines – which I am VERY serious about.
I also don’t include many redundant items. I keep my gear in top condition before and after every adventure. I’m never more than a day or two hike from a road and normally get cell reception in some part of my trip. I also carry a SPOT PLB for really serious situations. This isn’t doomsday prepping, it’s wilderness backpacking.
Finally – I do not carry a weapon or ‘protection’. I don’t normally go out where large predators are a concern and I’m never worried about other humans. I don’t own a gun and if I did I would not carry it backpacking – the need just isn’t there. If anything bear spray would be something I’d consider, but again – bear attacks are not a threat where I adventure.

So… let’s get to that list….

Backpack
I actually can’t make a solid recommendation here without a ton of caveats. In general – I recommend the Osprey and Gregory brands. If you keep your kit under 30 pounds there are also ‘ultralight’ style packs that are super comfortable, such as Gossamer and ZPacks. I highly recommend trying on a pack before you purchase. Everyone’s torso/back/neck/hips are unique and same with the kit you’ll put inside – there are just too many variables. Please don’t skimp here, you’ll regret every mile.

Shelter
Cheap: Blue Tarp plus rope and pegs - $15

Better: Tarptent Double Rainbow - $250 – this is a super general suggestion and without knowing more of a hikers personal desires it’s hard to make a good recommendation here. There are hammocks that people love or cheaper/expensiver options out there. MSR, Big Agnes, Eureka, Hilleberg, Kelty Salida $150, Sierra Designs, and REI are all top quality brands to consider.

Sleeping Bag
Cheap(ish): TNF Cat’s Meow - $170 – under this price range and you really need to question the bag’s quality. EN rating is key in this category. Some makers put their own degree rating on their bags, while quality brands go with the official EN rating for comfort. Whatever you choose – treat it well because sleeping bags can be ruined by mis-handling.

86,7 COMMON MISTAKES THE BEGINNER HIKERS MAKE,"    All opinions, remarks, and recommendations are welcome.

Beginner hikers make all kinds of mistakes and we don’t aim to address all of them. We just want to outline some common mistakes they do so that you avoid them in your hiking trips.

### 1. Overestimating their abilities

The worst thing you can ever do is think that you know enough. And it happens often, especially to novice hikers who do not have enough experience on the trail. Nothing can be compared to knowledge. Before starting a hike, it would be best to know everything you can. You should never take hiking lightly because there would be serious repercussions if you do so.

* Physical skills and abilities

Reading and references are important, but the one thing they cannot show you is how your own body and mind respond to the challenges. It’s true that only experience in a real situation will show you how your body responds to challenges. And without being in a challenging situation, you can only guess what your reactions will be.

* Mental skills and abilities

Most people think they are tough. Moreover, they are certain that their plans are flawless and nothing can break their spirit. Well, more than 20 years ago, Mike Tyson said something about that: “Everyone has a plan 'till they get punched in the mouth.” Expectations often do not meet reality and, unfortunately, inexperienced hikers are rarely aware of that.

### 2. Underestimating nature

* Trail conditions

Experience is the best teacher. This is true with everything, but it is very true with hiking. Some people despite all the hiking wisdom they have been given, never truly learn from it until they experience it the hard way. That’s what awaits you if you underestimate trail terrain and conditions.

* Weather conditions

Beginner hikers often skip or neglect the weather forecast and this is a recipe for disaster. So, always before a hiking trip, check the weather forecast and plan accordingly. Another common mistake is that they underestimate the importance of using sunscreen and thus risk sunburn. 

### 3. Not having the proper gear

Your choices of hiking footwear and pack are hugely important – these two are maybe the most important part of your hiking stuff. Don’t underestimate their importance and always pick up the best footwear for your feet and a pack you can carry comfortably and has the features designed to keep you hiking smartly.

* Footwear problems

Beginner hikers often rely on boots and shoes that are too tight. However, hiking boots should fit well and offer enough room to wiggle your toes. Try them on at the end of the day and with the socks, you plan to wear. Shoes should fit somewhat loose so that your feet have room to swell, which they will if you do a lot of miles. Many hikers choose shoes a half or full size bigger than they normally wear and sometimes go with wide sizes. When choosing a hiking shoe look for one that is lightweight, breathable, flexible, and fits your foot. For hiking in warm weather, pick up light shoes with breathable mesh panels, a rigid exoskeleton, and a reinforced toe cap. Trail\-running shoes and lightweight boots are a perfect choice for lightweight backpacking. Last but not least: never hit the trail with boots that aren’t broken in before your hiking trip. It’s another common mistake.

* Clothes problems

Wearing cotton instead of high\-tech fabrics, not having a rain jacket in a rainy weather, not having enough insulation in a place where it becomes cold at night and/or early in the morning \- novice backpackers do some or all of these.

### 4. Underpacking or overpacking

Usually bringing too much, although the opposite can be observed too. No matter if it’s too much food, hiking clothes, or gear, try to evaluate the contents of your pack before setting out for the backcountry. Evaluating your hiking equipment beforehand will lighten your load and make packing easier. Start with preparing a checklist for evaluating every single item you want to carry. Remember you only have one pack to carry all of your essentials and that pack will be on your back the entire trip. So be reasonable and don’t overpack.

* Not knowing your pack

Knowing your pack inside and out will make you more efficient in packing up and hiking. Know how your pack should adjust to your body with any weight in it. A good pack must be fitted, and it is important that this is done properly. A poorly fitted pack will prove unstable, uncomfortable, and so painful and inefficient that you may never want to go backpacking again.

* Not eating and drinking enough

Your best defense against illness and exhaustion is to eat a healthy breakfast and eat regularly throughout your hike. Eating after a long day of hiking is also important as well as snacks throughout the day. Always monitor food and water intake. The following two mistakes are very common: 1\) Carrying not enough water in warmer climates. For some areas, you need to carry not 2\-3 liters of water but up to 10 liters. If you carry more than you need, you can always dump out extra. 2\) Bringing unappetizing food. You need some source of energy and the best one is food rich in carbs, fats, and sugar. In a highly active lifestyle, such kind of a diet provides much\-needed energy that few other foods can match. However, many novice hikers try to maintain a health\-food diet on the trail. But most fail because they can’t get enough calories to keep pace with the massive energy needs of a long hike and the food becomes so monotonous and bland that it kills their morale and the will to continue.

### 5. Inaccurate walking pace

You should maintain a pace where you’re taking a full break every 45 minutes or so. For easy hikes and those with a high level of fitness, breaks might be after 1–2 hours of walking. Keep in mind that hiking speeds vary as widely as running speeds. You need not know exactly how far you’ll walk each day, or precisely where you’ll camp each night \(though such detailed planning is useful for beginners\), but you should know your capabilities and desires well enough to tailor your trip to them. So, test yourself, test your abilities in different situations, experiment, learn, and adapt. Never stop learning. Ever. 

### 6. Late packing

Packing on the morning of the hike. Do it the day before when you’re not in a rush. Figure out your clothes for a hike then too. While rushing you may forget something important like toilet paper, flashlight, fire starter, raincoat etc. Thus, always check to see if you have your necessities before you go for your hike.

### 7. Prone to logical fallacies

Hiking is about problem\-solving, and problem\-solving requires sound logic. Some of the most serious mistakes on the trail stem from an improper use of logic.

* The sunk cost fallacy

You irrationally cling to things that have already cost you something. What's the explanation? *When you've invested your time, money, or emotion into something, it hurts you to let it go. This aversion to pain can distort your better judgment and cause you to make unwise investments. A sunk cost means that you can't recover it, so it's rational to disregard the cost when evaluating*. A lot of beginner hikers don't want to let it go because 1\) But, we’ve come so far… 2\) But, we drove all this way… How to overcome the sunk cost fallacies? To regain objectivity, ask yourself: had I not already invested something, would I still do so now?

* Clutching at first solutions

Under pressure, you act impulsively especially when you don’t have enough experience. Often, you cling to your first solutions believing that they are correct even though there are enough facts to disprove your initial solution/decision.

* The Dunning\-Kruger effect

The more you know, the less confident you're likely to be. Because experts know just how much they don't know, they tend to underestimate their ability; but it's easy to be over\-confident when you have only a simple idea of how things are. That’s why lay\-people with only superficial knowledge often appear confident and behave accordingly.To sum up, beginner hikers are urged to start out slowly and build their way up. Mistakes can happen when building experience. Don't rush things, keep your head when facing challenges on the trail and work through the problem until finding a solution that works.

I’m looking for recommendations of trails and parks. Im also googling but figured folk here may have better suggestions than general websites. I haven’t hiked in the US national parks before so this is pretty exiting.

We have backpacking experience in Andes and Himalayas. Parents are in great form, obviously. We are looking for something more challenging than day hike style on forest path but not requiring rock climbing or ice axe/rope and such. Something with mountain passes, summits, and high ranges is very welcome. 

My parents are flying from abroad and I know are curious to see the diversity of US nature. So something unusual like deserts and canyons is also cool - as long as it can have nice level of difficulty.

57,PACKING FOR A MULTI-DAY HIKE,"*Guys, I hope that you'll like my latest post. It's a logical continuation of my previous post about packing for a day hike. Although not mentioned explicitly, this preparation is for a 5\-days hike. The original is at* [*https://www.camotrek.com/blogs/news/packing\-for\-a\-multi\-day\-hike*](https://www.camotrek.com/blogs/news/packing-for-a-multi-day-hike)

*You can find there all the links in the post including one to a 5\-day meal plan.*

*As usual, remarks, recommendations, and opinions are welcome.*

Preparing for a multi\-day hiking trip brings many more problems and concerns than preparing for a day hike. The right equipment can make the difference between a trip you want to repeat and a nightmare that will make you shudder every time you see a pack. In extreme circumstances, the inadequate gear could even be life\-threatening.

Three major factors govern the choice of gear: performance, durability, and weight. You need to pick your gear carefully and pack it efficiently because the heavier your load, the more often you need to stop and rest, the slower you walk, and the sooner you are likely to stop and make camp. As a rule, the lighter your pack, the more comfortable you’ll feel.

On longer trips, or when an extra gear is required, a large internal\-frame pack carries heavier loads comfortably. A frameless pack is also an option and although lighter, it is highly improbable that it will be as comfortable as a framed pack.

Pack needs to be well balanced: place the heaviest items \(such as food, water, stove fuel\) against your back and tighten the pack’s compression straps. Organize your gear into logical groups and stuff sacks. Make sure that when you start to unpack at camp, or on the track, items that you will need are grouped with other items and that there won’t be a ‘pack explosion’ as you try to find that one necessary just arrived at camp item that is now at the bottom or in the middle of your backpack. A neat well\-organized hiking pack, where you have a good idea where everything is, is important. Put your sleeping bag on the bottom. This provides a soft cushion for your other gear to ride on top of. It works like a shock absorber to reduce the impact on your shoulders and hips. Keep spare clothes near the top of your pack where you can get to them throughout the day without unpacking other gear. Keep items you’ll use often during the day \(such as snacks, maps, camera, water bottles\) where you can grab them without taking off your pack, like in hipbelt pockets or side pockets.

You will need appropriate and comfortable hiking footwear. Good hiking boots or shoes should: fit well; protect your feet; provide good traction; be durable, light, and breathable. Of course, sometimes you have to sacrifice speed for stability or comfort for durability, for example. A lot of hikers prefer using trail\-running shoes or hiking shoes because they’re light, breathable, and don't need to be broken in. Moreover, they dry faster than standard hiking boots. However, if you decide to put on boots, make sure they are broken in, otherwise, your hike might not be very enjoyable. Your choice of footwear is perhaps most critical when it comes to comfort and stability on uneven, slippery terrain.

Wear layers of clothes to match the forecast and season. Avoid cotton; bet on synthetics \- preferable polyester or merino wool. For changing weather get: two pairs of socks, polyester convertible pants, waterproof and breathable pants, polyester T\-shirt, polyester hiking shirt, fleece top, insulated jacket, rain jacket, two pairs of polyester underpants, base layer set, sun hat, warm beanie, and gloves \(if it’s cold\). It's worth reminding that if you have more clothes, you can always take off some of them in case it becomes too hot, however, you can’t put on layers that you didn't bring along.

When planning and organizing your hiking trip, follow these basic principles:

* Plan and organize your hike carefully – it takes time and energy to plan a multi\-day trip, however, the planning phase can be crucial for the overall outcome of your hike.
* Avoid excess weight and travel as light as possible. However, don’t go too far unless you are stoic enough to endure minimum comfort in camp in bad weather.
* There are huge price ranges \- especially in clothing, where high prices often just mean the latest style, color, or fabric rather than better performance. The simplest, lightest designs \- not the most expensive \- are often best.
* Don’t forget to let someone know where you are going and your route.

In addition to the pack, footwear, and clothing, you will need and some other essentials for your multi\-day hike. 

### Basic stuff:

* Sleeping bag \- select one according to the season, weather conditions, and temperatures. It's among the most important tools that will keep you warm at night together with your sleeping pad and shelter.
* Sleeping pad \- the primary function of a sleeping pad is to minimize conductive heat loss. It's very important to have a sleeping pad, especially when it's cold outside because neither the shelter nor the sleeping bag will help you feel warm enough if the shelter floor is cold or covered with snow. Additionally, sleeping pads also increase nighttime comfort with cushioning.
* Shelter \- must protect you from precipitation, wind, and insects. Depending on various factors but mainly on the weather, location, and your hiking style, you may choose to carry a tent \(recommended for most backpackers\), a tarp system or a hammock.
* Food for several days – your body will burn a lot of calories during hiking. In general, a 70 kg person burns between 430 and 440 calories per hour of hiking. A 90 kg person burns approximately 550 calories per hour of hiking.      Therefore, you need some source of energy and the best one is food rich in carbs, fats, and sugar. In a highly active lifestyle, such kind of a diet provides much\-needed energy that few other foods can match. For a five day trip, you can prepare a food list according to your taste or check this one.
* Cookware \- cook stove \(and enough fuel\), cook pot, food jar, and a spoon.
* Good amount of water \- depending on the location, water can go from an insignificant concern during the planning stages to the most important factor. So sometimes you might have to carry 4\-5 or more liters of water, while on other occasions the amount of water may not exceed a liter or two.
* A portable water filter is an indispensable tool for ensuring that you have clean drinking water during your hike into the backcountry.
* Trekking poles will reduce the strain and force of gravity on your legs when hiking. Most serious hikers consider them a critical piece of equipment.
* Backpack rain cover, pack liner, and dry sacks \(sleep bag sack, food sack, clothing sack, ditty sack\) will keep your stuff dry.
* Raincoat or a loose\-fitting poncho depending on the weather forecast and the hiking location.
* First aid kit and repair kit \- among the essentials in your first aid kit, you should include some analgesics/antibiotics/anaphylaxis \(Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Sting relief pad etc.\), bandages, antiseptic towelettes, blister care pads, 2""x2"" and 3""x3"" gauze sponges, safety whistle, water\-purifying tablets, fire starter. Your repair kit should include at least extra shoelaces, duct tape, and a multi\-purpose tool.
* Map and compass to orient yourself. Among the worst case scenarios when in the outdoors is getting lost and not having means to orient, especially if the place is totally unfamiliar to you.
* Toilet paper, hand sanitizer, wet wipes, and handkerchiefs for good personal hygiene.
* Sunglasses, sunscreen with UPF, lip balm are very important because you may get scorched if you underestimate the sun.
* Flashlight or headlamp is a must when being outdoors at night.
* Bear spray for self\-defense.
* Mobile phone in a shock and waterproof case so that it stays safe and secure.
* Camera
* Wallet and documents
* Toothbrush and toothpaste
* Quick\-drying towel

In addition to the basic stuff, you may wish to carry with you some extra items. Depending on the season, location, and personal preferences, some of the enumerated extra items might turn into essential packing items.

### Extra stuff:

* Gaiters can be of good use depending on the season and terrain.
* Signal mirror
* Insect repellent
* Book or a Kindle – especially useful if you prefer solo hiking.
* Notebook and pen
* GPS
* Binoculars
* Multi\-function watch with altimeter
* Toilet trowel
* Bear canister 

In general, aim to carry no more than 15\-20 kg of gear including your food and water supplies added to the clothes on your back. On rare occasions, you’ll have to carry a heavier load. Bring enough water, especially when hiking in arid regions since water is, by far, the most important thing you’ll carry with you on a hike in an arid environment. If you’re traveling with a group, sharing camping and cooking equipment will reduce this a little; specialized and warmer gear for winter conditions will add to it. Remember that the way weight feels is subjective depending on such factors as terrain, weather conditions, physical condition, and even hiking experience.

Be conservative in planning your hike. There is no such thing as too much information. Just sort it out and figure out what’s really important and what’s not of value for your hike. You enter into a world in which planning and preparation, self\-reliance, and good choices are crucial.

And finally, remember that good gear is not a substitute for skill – it’s far more important to have knowledge, skills, and experience than to buy only the latest high\-tech designs. Even without the best gear, get outside and hike. Nature is not your rival. It's beautiful, authentic, and you should respect it. ",hiking,1527802593,Camotrek,0,1,True,2018-05-31

78,Hike recommendations for Los Angeles region,"Hello, 

I live on the East coast of Canada where I do most of my hiking. I also go to New York, New Hampshire and Maine to hike.

On the 25th of June I will go on a business trip to Los Angeles (near the Old Town Torrance according to Google Maps). 

My boss has agreed that I could expend the trip at my expanse to do some hiking. Hiking on the west coast (either Canada or the USA) is on my bucket list.

I will have about 2 days (maybe 3 if my schedule would allow it but that isn't sure for now).

I don't know anything about the region and I don't know if/when I'll ever be back. Because of this I want to make the most of my experience.

Do you have suggestions for:
* 2 days of 1 day hikes
OR
* A single 2 day hike in that region (an overnight)

Something not too far, I will have to rent a car to travel there and get back to the airport in time to catch a plane. 

My first thought was Yosemite but after checking on the maps it's farther from LA than I thought so I may waste too much time in transportation.

I have done solo hiking (4 day trip, several overnights) plus a couple of overnights in groups before. The tallest mountain I have climbed is Mount Adams in New Hampshire (I will go climb Mount Washington in New Hampshire in 2 weeks).

83,PACKING FOR A DAY HIKE,"Guys, I hope that you'll like my latest post.

Once you know more about hiking footwear, clothing, hazards on the trail, and you have your own reasons to start hiking, you can start preparing for your new adventure. For those who are just starting to hit the trails, day hikes are the safest and easiest way to start. Just pick up a comfortable hiking pack which fits and start packing \(an ordinary daypack will also suffice\).

How you pack gear depends on the sort of hiking you‘re doing, which items you‘re likely to need during the day, and the type of pack you have. Low\-bulk items should be packed high and near to your back to keep the load close to your center of gravity and enable you to maintain an upright stance. It‘s important that the load is balanced so the pack doesn‘t pull to one side. The items you‘ll need the most during the day should be accessible, and it helps to know where everything is.

Depending on the surface, weather conditions, the distance of the trail, and your own preferences, you will need appropriate and comfortable hiking boots, lightweight shoes or trail\-running shoes. If you decide to put on boots, make sure they are broken in. Keep in mind that the choice of hiking footwear can make or break the entire experience. 

Wear layers of clothes to match the forecast and season. Layering is essential, especially when hiking in the mountains. Your best bet is to rely on a clothing system composed of specialized items that can be easily adjusted and mixed and matched with changes in environmental conditions and your level of exertion. Consider tech\-fabric clothing for those full\-day adventures and avoid cotton. Get a jacket if it’s cold or you expect it to become cold and don’t forget that if you have more clothes, you can always take off some of them in case it becomes too hot, however, you can’t put on layers that you didn't bring along. It's also important to have the ability to remove or add items easily.

Let's start first with some recommendations so that you pack as efficiently as you can:

* Avoid excess weight.
* Travel as light as possible. The heaviest items in your pack should be food and water.
* Buy good and appropriate footwear. Don’t forget properly sized wool socks.
* Get a good hiking daypack or backpacking pack. A reliable backpack for a day hike should be durable, light, water\-repellent, with multiple compartments, has a padded back with air mesh for better ventilation and more comfort. A pack designed to distribute weight to your hips, maybe hydration compatible too.
* Keep items you’ll use often during the day where you can grab them without taking off your pack, like in hipbelt pockets or side pockets.
* Keep spare clothes near the top of your pack where you can get to them throughout the day without unpacking other gear.
* Make up a small first aid kit.
* Don’t forget common life stuff you use.
* Don’t buy gear just because it's popular or pricey – high prices and famous brands do not make products more valuable – your purchasing decision should depend on whether you need something or not.
* Don’t forget to let someone know where you are going and your route.

Having said that, we can start with the day hike essentials.

### Basic stuff:

* Food \(lunch plus snacks\) – since it is a one day hike, choose whatever lunch you'd like to eat. Additionally, get some snacks high in carbohydrates, fat, and sugar like snickers, granola bars, chocolate, almonds or other types of nuts. Your best defense against illness and exhaustion is to eat a healthy breakfast and eat regularly throughout your hike. When packing food, make sure it isn’t going to leak or spill.
* Good amount of water \(proper hydration\) – 2 to 3 liters, in summer even more – preferably in a water bladder. Additionally, you might also carry some water in a plastic or stainless steel water bottle.
* Backpack rain cover and/or dry bag – you need to keep your gear dry and functioning. Both of these are lightweight and do not take a lot of space, however, they can be very useful if the weather turns wet.
* Raincoat \(an umbrella or a loose\-fitting poncho can be good options too\) depending on the weather forecast and the hiking location.
* First aid kit \- an outer container made of durable nylon is optimal and protects contents. Among the essentials in your first aid kit, you should include some analgesics/antibiotics/anaphylaxis \(Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Sting relief pad etc.\), bandages, antiseptic towelettes, blister care pads, 2""x2"" and 3""x3"" gauze sponges, safety whistle, water\-purifying tablets, extra shoelaces, fire starter, duct tape, multi\-purpose tool.
* Map and compass to orient yourself.
* Mobile phone in a shock and waterproof case so that it stays safe and secure.
* Toilet paper, hand sanitizer, and handkerchiefs for good personal hygiene.
* Sun hat, sunglasses, sunscreen with UPF are very important because you may get scorched if you underestimate the sun.
* Warm hat and gloves if it’s cold – it is important on cold days to conserve body heat, otherwise, you lose heat through your head.
* Flashlight or headlamp in case it becomes dark outside and you're still on the trail.
* Bear spray for self\-defense if you encounter a bear and it charges you.

In addition to the basic stuff above, you may wish to carry with you some extra items.

### Extra stuff:

* Trekking poles \- for those who need added stability on steeper trails. Use trekking poles to take stress off your muscles, joints, and ligaments.
* Gaiters can be of good use depending on the terrain.
* Personal Locator Beacon \(PLB\) is important in areas of poor phone coverage and provides a powerful safety net for wilderness travelers.
* Signal mirror
* Insect repellent
* Camera

Be conservative in planning your hike. You enter into a world in which planning and preparation, self\-reliance, and good choices are crucial. And finally, one good advice from the U.S. National Park Service: “Get the weather forecast. Don't overestimate your capabilities. Hike intelligently.” ",hiking,1527634554,Camotrek,0,1,True,2018-05-29

46,TEN HIKING HAZARDS YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF,"Guys I posted this a few days ago in my personal blog. I hope that you'll like it and give some opinions about the post and maybe about other hiking hazards not mentioned here.

Hiking can be very exciting and rewarding, making memories for life; however, you should never forget that nature sometimes can be particularly cruel if you aren’t prepared to meet some challenges related to this activity and be caught off guard. There are always details and dangers you should know that are specific to the environment you are hiking in. Remember that underestimating nature and natural forces can not only be a costly mistake but your last one. Having said that, there are some hiking hazards you should be prepared for:

* **Avalanche**

While there will be times where you cannot help being in the midst of an avalanche, there are tools and forecasts that will help you to stay updated on the conditions for the day.

The best thing to do to avoid an avalanche disaster is to steer clear of any snow\-covered mountains. However, if you happen to be in the path of a sudden oncoming avalanche, try to move uphill and to the side, in order to avoid the pile\-up. You will not be able to outrun it, so don’t try. Just get to the side as quickly as you can to avoid the center, where the snow will be at its deepest. If you’re getting closed in on, drop your equipment and move fast. If there are trees around, try to grab onto one. Although not easy, this will possibly save your life if you can manage to scramble up into a branch quick enough.

If you’re getting buried, try to relax your body and your breathing to conserve energy and oxygen. The more you strain, the deeper you’ll sink. As soon as you’re under, dig a small pocket with your hand or a shovel and this will provide an extra oxygen for you to breathe while waiting for rescuers to find you.

* **Blizzard or Snowstorm**

Struggling on into the teeth of a blizzard when you don’t have to is foolish and risky. It even may be necessary to sit out bad weather for a day or more. A spare pair of gloves and socks to keep on your person is always good to have, along with some food. If you’re camping in the winter, for example, and your site starts to experience a heavy snowfall, you’ll want to make sure that you’ve got enough preserved food to hold you through a few days of rough weather.

Staying hydrated is perhaps the most important thing. A lack of proper hydration will significantly increase your chances of catching hypothermia and frostbite. The easiest way to get some drinkable water is by melting snow with a gas/oil stove like Primus. Once it’s melted, you can drink it without worry. If you’re stuck outside and completely alone during a blizzard, do your best to find some form of shelter.

* **Falls**

Many tourists have died while posing for pictures by scrambling around or just walking too close to a canyon rim. Backcountry hikers have slipped or fallen descending friable rock and talus. Stay focused, use common sense, extreme care, and good hiking footwear or don’t do it. Step back or turn around and stay safe.

* **Floods**

Floods are most likely to occur in early spring when temperatures rise and snow melts. Most floods happen slowly, over a period of days, but when particular floods come on suddenly \(the so\-called ""flash floods""\), they can be fatal.

The first and most important thing to do is to try to get to higher ground. You won’t want to be in the path of the flood. Also, remember that this water isn’t drinkable because it consists of water, mud, clay, and other materials swept away by the flood.

If you need to cross flood waters, and you’re alone, find a pole or a long, sturdy stick to help you while crossing. If you get caught in rushing waters, try to grab a hold of a grounded structure, such as a tree. Being caught in the middle of a natural disaster is terrifying because it is completely uncontrollable. There is nothing to do but wait it out and try to stay alive during the worst of it.

* **Flash floods**

During flash floods, the water level increases almost instantly. What was a dry creek you walked up an hour ago could in minutes be a raging torrent of water carrying entire trees and large rocks. If caught in a flash flood you may only have seconds to react. If you hear an increasing roar of water, you will only have a few moments to get to high ground. So, do it immediately! That may be your only chance to survive and you should act as fast as possible to try to get out of the flash flood’s way. Remember the best way to survive a flash flood is just to not put yourself in that situation.

Flash floods are a natural force impossible to reckon with unless you’re standing on high ground out of harm’s way. Sudden and unpredictable, they continue to devastate everything in their paths with little warning, not just hikers, but the local people and their community, homes, farms, and livestock.

* **River crossings**

Unbridged rivers and streams can present major hazards. Water is more powerful than many people think, and hikers are drowned every year fording what may look like relatively placid streams. If you don’t think you can cross safely, don’t try. In the end, only experience can tell you whether it’s possible to cross. If you decide fording is feasible, study your crossing point carefully before plunging in. If the water is fast flowing and starts to boil up much above your knees, turn back \- it could easily knock you over, and being swept down a boulder\-littered stream is not good for your health.

Seasoned hikers commonly cross slow water without incident. But this is a serious, personal safety issue you should strongly consider before embarking on a rim\-to\-rim hike. Sometimes river crossings can be made as easy as swimming or paddling driftwood logs or small rafts at low water when river temperatures are sufficiently high. However, for example, mountain water is very cold, and you’ll often reach the far side feeling shivery. Remember that safety should be your top priority when you head out on the trail. Know that water can be dangerous so it is important to take your time at water crossings and be especially mindful of the environment.

* **Rockfalls**

In most places, it’s a rare event, caused often by flash floods, winter storms or earthquakes. Stay out of the fall line and wild rumbling creek and debris flows. When hiking switchbacks or cross\-country, make sure you stay out of the fall line of hikers and mules that can accidentally dislodge a rock from above.

* **Sprains** 

Storms, erosion, and hikers are constantly changing the conditions of most trails and routes. Make sure your physical condition and hiking footwear can meet the demands of rugged terrain and sharp rocks and that they provide you with adequate cushioning and ankle support.

* **Weather**

Most outdoor hazards are caused by the weather. Wind, rain, snow, thunderstorms, freezing temperatures, thaws, and heat waves all introduce difficulties or dangers. For any given trip, knowing in general what weather to expect should be part of your trip planning. Get the most reliable weather report for your area and check it when planning your hike and again right before you leave. If you’re going to an unfamiliar area, checking weather patterns for some time in advance can give you an idea of what to expect. For a specific day, check the internet, radio, television, and newspaper forecasts if you can, although even the most detailed recent forecast can be wrong. Mountains are particularly notorious for creating their own weather while the weather has less impact on travel over low\-level and below\-timberline routes.

* **Wildfires**

Wildfires are highly dangerous and most of them are started by humans, though unintentionally. Dry grasses and trees, a gust of strong wind, and a heat source as small as a half\-smoked cigarette or the dying embers of a campfire can cause huge fires. Even a bolt of lightning or heat from the sun can cause a wildfire.

Fires can move quickly, especially in windy, hot conditions. Always have an escape route planned in the event a fire starts near you. Finding hikes far from known fire locations is best to avoid any potential issues. However, if you turn out to be near a wildfire, you better know where the nearest water source is, and how far you are from it. The ideal form of protection would be to get in the water. Outrunning wildfires are very hard to do and you’ll spend all of your needed energy passing up on possible places to wait out the blaze. If you are on a mountain or a hillside, get to the back. You want the flames to travel over you, rather than toward you. Seek shelter under a cliff or a large rock. If possible, put a face mask \(if you don’t have one, try to improvise by using a wet shirt or some other part of your clothing\) so that the smoke does not choke you.

""Pray for the best; prepare for the worst"" as the old saying goes. It is your preparedness and quick reaction that might make the difference between life and death when you need to handle an emergency situation. So, be prepared.",hiking,1527283898,Camotrek,4,1,True,2018-05-25

So in a couple of weeks, I’ll be in Minneapolis for a week and would like to do some hiking in the surrounding area. 
I’ll be mobile with a car and I’m looking for hiking rounds anything between 4 and 10 hours. 
They don’t necessarily need to be marked hiking trails, I like going less walked trails as well, as long as I have GPS routes available.

Does anyone have any recommendations? Or maybe an idea where to start looking online? Back here in Germany I know the websites where I can download the GPS data for hiking routes and load them on my Suunto watch, but those sites don’t have any data on the US.
A nod into the right direction would be great! :)

56,Baby carrier dilemma,"Hello everyone. I plan to buy a baby carrier for hiking in the future but still not decided which one to pick. My choice is between two Deuter models : kid comfort air and kid comfort 3.

•Kid comfort Air : 
Lighter, better air flow in the back and for the kid, I work in a shop and they sold this model so with my discount it's cheaper (comes at 140€), comes with rain and sun protection and I have a 2y extended warranty.

•Kid comfort 3 :
More comfortable, more space available to carry stuff. Comes with sun protection, Can also get a warranty extension. Comes with teddy bear. The rain protection is better.

I suppose Kid comfort Air is better in hot weather but I hike also during autumn and winter so I am not sure if it will be suited for those kind of weather. I also find the rain protection to be quite small compared to the comfort 3.

Long story short, I can't decide, does someone have some feedback/advice about any of the two ?",hiking,1527333222,jexinator,0,1,True,2018-05-26

56,FIVE REASONS TO START HIKING NOW,"The typical answer when you ask someone how they started hiking would be something like this:

* “Well, I used to go walking in the country with my father/mother and just developed a love of the outdoors and adventure and hiking/backpacking was the only way to get there. And I learned how to survive in the wild and how to recognize wildlife and plants. That really adds to the enjoyment.”
* “I just started walking and hiking locally for exercise and to stay in shape. I hate gyms. I keep looking at the clock and wanting to finish. With hiking, you can’t finish until you get back to the trailhead. I learned my limitations and I learned how to plan my hikes and my longer adventures.”
* “Everything started while I was at school – maybe 9th or 10th grade when my geography teacher got me into hiking, taking me and my fellow students to a popular local trail. Next year, I became a member of a hiking club and the rest is history.”

People hike for many reasons \- for enjoyment, for recreation, for relaxation, for a challenge, for change, to revitalize, to think, to connect with nature. There are as many reasons as there are people. Here are our five reasons for you to put on a pair of hiking shoes and start your adventure NOW:

**The challenge and reward of the accomplishment of reaching a destination**

Let’s face it: hiking can be a challenge – a wet, cold \(or hot\), nasty, grueling challenge. You never know exactly what is going to happen on your trail. And that’s among its coolest features! A character is built in a place that demands every moment of your attention.

Think of yourself as an adventurous walker rather than anything else. No matter how tired you are, when your hike is finished, and you start thinking about the post\-hike, it gives you a burst of energy. If you haven't tried it, your next hike is a chance to give it a go. It rounds up a pleasant day outdoors perfectly and brings it to a perfect closure. At the end of the day, deep, refreshing sleep is guaranteed.

**The uncertainty and discomfort of the unknown**

Yes, uncertainty added to discomfort isn’t always equal to an adventure but it may well be. Some people immediately love the adventure and the possibility that they could still reinvent themselves. It also helps if you loath indoor gyms because hiking is an exercise without the tedium. Additionally, hiking can also be an exercise on the technicality. One thing keeps leading to another, and before you know it, you’re officially hooked on planning your next adventure.

Nature is authentic. An environment bereft of technology or ample, comfortable, well\-lit spaces. It is inspiring and ennobling and you just can’t get enough of it. The uncertainty and discomfort of the unknown are frightening no more; you even welcome them because you realize that you have become an explorer and fear is not an option anymore.

**Connect with nature**

Whether on a quiet walk in the summer woods, an exciting scramble high in the mountains, a long\-distance trail hike, or a journey in the snow and cold of winter, nature has got a lot of resources to offer. Enjoy it without destroying it. Just get out and enjoy nature, fresh air, spectacular views; get away from people and mundane activities. Vast wilderness, beautiful sceneries, serenity… Nature offers all these and more. Big trees that can be more than 100 years old and the sounds of birds can literally make you a new person.

**Physical and mental benefits**

There are many reasons why going for a hike is best for your health. No doubt, hiking is considered to be an exercise which decreases blood pressure and lowers the risk of heart disease. Frequent hiking will lower the risk of type 2 diabetes \(hiking helps you control or even prevent diabetes because it lowers your blood sugar levels\), fight osteoporosis and arthritis by developing strong bones. It helps you exercise muscle groups and burn excessive calories. Hiking is also a natural way for relieving stress – it improves your mood. A short\-term bonus is that it really doesn’t feel like exercise. It actually boosts your energy. A long\-term bonus is that this experience creates moments that will live in the memory for a lifetime. You will recall the jagged peaks of the Rockies; walking through timeless and eternal primeval forests; watching the sunset over glacier\-clad mountains, and the joy of being in the natural world among animals and plants. Priceless.

**A cheap form of entertainment with some additional benefits**

If you have the right attitude, hiking is never boring. It can actually be very entertaining, especially if you have a companion or two. The more the merrier! Plus, interaction with the larger hiking community encourages you to engage with your workout as a lifestyle, rather than a chore, which will make you more likely to stick with it for the long haul. Additionally, spending some time hiking in the outdoors is much healthier than eating popcorn at the local movie theater.

One thing’s for sure – whichever reason to start hiking you choose you won’t go wrong. ",hiking,1527119488,Camotrek,11,1,True,2018-05-23

From the pictures I've seen so far, as long as I have my hand on the chain, I think I would be okay, but my fear is that it'll be crowded and that there will be times when I won't be able to use the chain due to the narrow path and two-way traffic.

*About me*: I'm in pretty good physical shape. ~15% body fat.

37,Advice for visiting Scottish hikers (Yosemite),"Hi folks, my fiance and I have a road trip planned later in the year (19th August to 11th September) the route is going to take us through Yosemite so with both of us being avid Munro Baggers back in our native land I figured we couldn't pass up the opportunity to take in a couple of hikes during our stay. We are both pretty fit and have climbed a fair amount of hills in Scotland and walked some fairly decent trails. That being said we are on holiday so not looking to stretch ourselves too much given our time constraints.

We are leaving Vegas on or around the 26th of August and the plan was to drive straight into Yosemite and spend 4 nights in Half Dome village or Big Trees Lodge. We've since though that it could be an idea to stay in Mammoth Lakes for two nights then onto Half Dome/Lodge for the next two nights. How's that sound? We'd like to take in two decent hikes and maybe a couple of small walks during that time. 

Can anyone help out with an suggestions on some suitable hikes from either location? Also are permits an issue in these areas? Some light googling seemed to make reference to some routes requiring permits.

Having never hiked in the states before what should we be prepared for?

50,[Gear] The least bulky waterproof low-rise hiking shoe?,"Can anyone rec a waterproof hiking shoe that's significantly less bulky than most?

It's not just for hiking. I like to wear my hiking shoes for yardwork, walking the dogs, etc. Waterproof is a must, but I can't seem to find a pair that aren't very bulky. I get it, with waterproofing comes more bulk. That can't be avoided. But I have very long, shallow feet. So even in everyday shoes, I already feel like I'm stomping around in boats. But when I wear my GTX Salomons, I *really* feel like a clown.

I'd also settle for a pair that's not *technically* WP, but that someone can attest still stays pretty dry, at least in wet grass/around the house. Not full\-on submersion.

55,Hiking with Hyperhidrosis?,"I'm new to hiking and interested in upgrading from my tennis shoes to hiking boots. One thing that keeps coming up in my research is the importance of boots that keep the feet dry. That's an odd problem for me: I have a genetic condition that makes my hands and feet sweat heavily and constantly. For example, I once sat at the dining room table without socks for ~15 minutes, and my SO thought our large dog had peed on the floor. I can sweat through a pair of heavy leather boots in about an hour when I really get going (and by sweat through, I mean create visible wet spots &gt; 2"" in diameter on the outside of the boot). 

So dry feet aren't an option for me. Synthetic socks and shoes have historically done poorly for me, even when they're supposed to be wicking for good for sweat.

118,Homeless Veteran Walks America Four Times For Charities. Check Out The Book!,"**500 Autographed Copies to Help Support Homeless**

I became homeless after I got out of the army and decided to walk across America. I ended up hiking and cycling all over the US for three years, where I traveled from Tennessee to Delaware, to California, to Florida, to Alaska, back to Florida, and back to California again. During that time, I was raising money for St. Jude, Wounded Warriors Project, and Shot at Life.

Once I had completed my third cross country trek, claiming over 10,000 miles, I had developed severe patella tracking disorder in my knees. After collapsing on the Golden Gate Bridge, I knew that it was time to throw in the towel. At least until I was able to recuperate.

After all of that, I made my way back to Tennessee, where I was still homeless and became ill. That’s when I was diagnosed with cancer. I thought the end had come, but I wanted to write a book about my travels before my time was up. I powered through the debilitating side effects from the treatment, finished my book, and regained my health.

Now, I am walking around the US and selling my books to help fund a homeless outreach project, where I'll be documenting the homeless people in our country. Besides documenting their cases, I'll be helping them obtain drivers licenses, mailing addresses, finding support groups, setting up bank accounts, helping them file for disability, finding food banks, building a resume', etc.

The bus arrives at 1200 the first day, and leaves at 1600 the following day.  Is it at all possible to do the trail in that time, or is that a foolish idea?  On paper, I could easily do 55km in 28 hours, but I am not familiar with the difficulty of the trail.

2) On average, how harsh is the weather on the trail in mid-June.  I plan to bring good clothes and camping gear, but I am worried bad weather might slow me down and ruin my strict time limit.

3)  If for whatever reason I miss the Thorsmork bus, what are my option for getting back to Reykjavik that evening?  Is there enough car traffic to hitchhike?

I've been trying to find a good 4e (or ideally 6e) hiking boot for some time now. I usually wear about a 10.5 6e, but a 4e can work sometimes depending on the shoe.

Not that they were too narrow around the ball of my foot -- just caused pain from walking after a while. Not good shoes for me.

But I  do carry one backpack for the both of us \(I don't mind all\).

I have a pretty broad back so I don't mind a bigger backpack in general \(small/supper narrow ones look ridiculous on me\). I checked out a couple of models from gregory as well as osprey. Both have very cool models, but I'm just not sure  volume\-wise which way to go. Of course I do a fitting at a local store later, but right now it is more about narrowing it down … 

Here is what a kind of stuff we usually pack \(current backpack is a Haglöfs Tight Pro, older model – don't know how liter it is actually\):

\- 2 bottles water, 2 boxes of tupperware filled with food, sun screen, first aid kit, sun screen, 1 pair of trekking pole, 1 towel, 2 buffs, 2 sun glasses, pair of flip\-flops and some minor stuff \(keys, wallet, mobile, meds, battery pack \(for mobile\)\)

Additionally the new backpack should hold:

\- clothes \(2 sweaters, 2 rain jackets/trousers, 2 pairs of socks\), hydration bladder, camera incl. 1\-2 lenses

\- a compartment to store dirty cloth \(I could abuse a sleeping back compartment for that\)

With all this stuff it shouldn't be completely packed, so it is to a certain degree future proof.

I wanna do a loop in Minnesota sometime pretty quick. Not finding anything, so I was thinking of starting at Judge Magney and finally checking out Devil’s Kettle.

As with typical hiking etiquette, anytime we pass someone on a trail we say hello and occasionally stop to chat for a minute or two, which is perfectly fine. However, on two occasions we have had a solo single guy who took it a bit further then I would call appropriate.

On both occasions the guys started chatting (both times primarily talking with my wife) and did not seem to know when enough was enough. On one occasion the guy actually said he would love to hike the trail with us...and perhaps it's just me, but that crosses a line. I obviously am here to hike with my wife...not to hike with my wife and some random guy who is borderline flirting with my wife.

Unfortunately my wife is the friendly type who feels rude if she cuts someone off when they are talking...so both times I had to be stern and tell the guy we wanted to hike alone.

Moab FST
Capra Bolt

So glad I found this sub, as my husband and I used to hike trails in the state park near our apartment all the time and we've really been looking forward to getting back out there - this time with our dog! The biggest reason we stopped going out is that ticks are a very big issue in our area (southwestern PA) and we have been very nervous about taking our dog out into the woods. We have a 3 year old Siberian husky, and he has that really thick coat that makes it difficult for us to find ticks on him right away. I really want to take him out with us, though, because he loves being outdoors and I just want to share everything with him; he goes everywhere with us! 


He tends to have trouble with the topical flea and tick treatments (Advantix, Frontline, etc.) and it irritates his skin. I've heard really great things about the Seresto collar and have been thinking about going for that. Does anyone have any thoughts? My only hangup is that it might also irritate his skin, but I'm thinking if it's not directly up against his skin (like the topical liquid), it might not be as bad. My other option is the chewables (Nexgard, etc) but if you guys have good luck with the Seresto collar, I'd rather try that as it's half the price and you don't need a prescription.

I'll also take any other advice on hiking with your doggos that you think might be helpful! I can't wait to get him out and about with us. We will be starting kind of small with him to see how he handles it and to get him used to it but I think we are all going to have a great time.

36,Recommendations on multiple days hiking in Scandinavia focusing on old trees and large mammals ?,"Hello, I'd like to hike in either Finland, Norway or Sweden which have plenty of awesome places, some of which very well preserved in their intact wilderness, however I have trouble finding one which would be a must.

Having quite some experience on backpacking and sleeping in my tent through seasons, as well as having seen old world large predators at a distance may make me picky on my choice (for example I'm not losing my mind over a forest which shows signs of clear cutting or exploitation), however I think there may be some places worth wandering into.

From what I got after screening the national parks of these 3 countries, Norway is probably the richest in rough terrain and scenic views but the poorest in regards to fauna conservation, while Finland is probably the richest among them on fauna and Sweden probably is halfway between (no pun intended). Also some national parks allow hunting and fishing so I am wondering if I should look into applying for a permit into one of those areas more strictly preserved, either on my own or through the university I'm working in.

I won't mind to spot reindeer, musk ox, moose, wolverine, lynx or other mammals, however given that they usually are shy I would like to make sure that I can at least count on hiking through old-growth forests made up of possibly large trees, so if the area has both in the same place it'd be perfect.

Being able to move by canoe rented locally would be a plus too but not necessarily needed.

45,Advice for Australian solo female wanting to hike around the USA.,"Solo, 24 year old, Australian female here, looking for hiking advice from locals, regulars and people who have done the same.

It has been a dream of mine to hike the national parks of the USA for a while now. More recently has it been a real nagging thought, which I have begun to save for and have anticipated leaving sometime next year. I have completed a certificate in Outdoor Recreation, this covered orienteering, hiking leadership, wilderness safety &amp; first aid and everything of the likes. However, it has been a while and so I will be joining a local hiking group to build my knowledge &amp; fitness before leaving. I have a friend I will be visiting, I will leave all details of each hike with her. Also with my family back home as back-up.

Now with that said, my biggest obstacle is the difference between AUS and USA. Our most dangerous animals are snakes &amp; spiders, we encounter them regularly and they are easy to deal with. USA.... has things that want to eat me. I've been trying to do some research on parks pages, reddits and blogs, but I would love some real answers.

Hiking in the USA for dummies:

What parks are great for solo hikers, must do and/or safe? (Definitely Yosemite &amp; Appalachian.)

When &amp; Where - What time is best for me? Are there any town hubs near park entries that cater for hiking tourists? Can I book into hostels to do day visits?

Equipment - Level of clothing will I need, tent, sleeping bag rating, cooker, etc.? What should I bring from home &amp; what should I buy? Renting?

Animals - What will I come across? How do you deal with this as a solo hiker?

Bears - Bear Spray? How would I store my food? Signs of bears?

Safety - Any advice, concerns? Are there groups or sites I can join to find like-minded travellers? 

Thank you! Any other info I might find useful please let me know.

Over the past few months, I have been exercising more than normal to try and prepare. However, being 18 years old and still in school, I find it difficult to fit in time for long hikes. I am really bad about struggling to stick to a workout routine, so I am very irregular when it comes to preparing for this hike. Over the past couple of months, I have been working out at the gym 2-3 times a week and have been trying to go on longer hikes (usually 5+ miles, sometimes only 3) at least twice a week. With there only being 1 month left, I am starting to worry about whether I am ready for this or not. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks so much.

Extra info: I am 18, and I have never been on the skinny side. I am currently 6'2"" and 220 lbs. I am definitely a bit overweight, but I have been on many hikes in the Appalachians and Rockies and have never really had a problem. We are going to Colorado soon for a week to practice as well, and that should definitely help. I just see all of this info online and it makes me think that I have to be in the best shape of my life to climb this mountain.",hiking,1525110834,pjk120,0,1,True,2018-04-30

I'm going on a trip around the Manaslu Circuit Trek, Nepal, last week of October, first 2 weeks of November.

I really need some advice from somebody who's been there. What kind of boots would you suggest ? \(70l backpack \- no porter\)

I already own a pair of TNF Ultra Fastpack III Mid GTX, very lightweight and comfy but  not very supportive and warm.

The foot tent to slide down when the path goes downhill becouse of the lacing system and I feel like my feet are too much close to the ground  while walking on hiking trails.

I'd like to try out: 

\- Salewa Hiking boots \(Ms Crow GTX, Raven 2 GTX\)

\- La Sportiva Hiking boots \(Trango Tower GTX, Nucleo GTX\)

\- Tecnica Forge S

\- Hoka ONE ONE Tor Ultra Hi WP \(I'm addicted to Hoka shoes, my everyday shoes are the Hoka Bondi 5. Once you put on your feet a pair of these it's quite hard to judge the comfort of another pair...not joking\)

I've already tried:

\- Salomon Quest 4D 3 \(good but heavy and warm...\) 

\- Lowa Renegade GTX \(not a good feeling out of the box\)

First of, I own high profile classic type hiking boots which are sadly too big and blistered my feet badly a year ago. As I was searching for some boots recommendations I encountered numerous opinions about trail running shoes being the way to go.
I do recognise the perks they offer but I need to mention that I foremost require versatility as I sometimes hike without a backpack, sometimes with a very light one and occasionally bulking up to about 15 kg (soz I don’t do lbs yikes).
I would like to have a shoe that better or worse can do it all. According to the terrains I do hike in higher Tatra mountains, laid-back Bieszczady and in July i plan to walk 100 km Kungsleden in Sweden. I do not plan to bear very heavy backpack maybe up to 15 kg.
I am looking for a shoe that could support (idk maybe 20 kg) backpack, breathe easily (my feet tend to sweat), be waterproof and most importantly comfortable.
Idk if that’s relevant but I’m quite fit, weighting about 80 kg. 
What drew my attention was a type of a shoe which is a hybrid between a trail-runner and a hiking boot. I am thinking about three models for now:

The Norh Face Ultra 110 GTX: https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/mens-ultra-110-gtx-nf0a2vux

Salomon X Ultra GTX: https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/mens-ultra-110-gtx-nf0a2vux

Merrel Moab 2 GTX: https://www.merrell.com/US/en/moab-2-gore-tex/27939M.html

Does the type of these shoes reflect my needs?
Please review my problem. I will be grateful for your feedback.

**USMC RAT Mojave Gore-Tex**

- Great in jungle terrain, muddy
- 4.3lb a pair, but I don't care about the weight.

36,Burroughs Range Hike (First time hiker questions),"I just recently got stationed in New York and I'm wanting to take advantage of the nearby areas. I did some research and the Burroughs Range seems like an awesome place to start. I've never really hiked before, so I don't really know how it all works with regards to planning (parking in particular).

That being said, if I wanted to hike the Burroughs Range next weekend where do I start? Do I park my truck somewhere, hike to the summit, and then turn around? I have a tent if the Burroughs Range can't be done in one day, which raises another question. Are there campsite locations off the trail spread throughout? Can I just camp anywhere far enough off the trail or is camping even allowed?

I've done some research. I saw that you can start the hike from the Woodlands Valley Campground, but then I found out it's not opened until May 18th. Is there another way to hike the trail without parking there? I saw something about a trailhead (not sure what that means exactly) being located on Route 47, but I have no idea where that is or how to get to it. Is a trailhead where you start? 

I feel like once I get my first solo hike done, it'll be easier for me to plan future ones on my own. I just figured I'd ask you guys here, since I have no experience with the process.

During the camping trip I have 2 ""rest"" days that I will not be hiking during the 7 days that I'm there alone. As well as plenty of unplanned time after a hike in the late afternoon / evening. I will not have cell service or connection to the outside world where I am camping. After every major hike I will be driving to a nearby town to let my emergency contacts know I am safe and survived the hike that was scheduled for that day.

The advice I am looking for is how do you handle all the down time? I expect to gain some spiritual awareness and to have a TON of internal dialog.

Most of my outdoor activities are trad/sport day climbs less than 8 pitch and never multi day.  I haven't been incharge of a multi day hike but have been on a few in the past 10 years.

What do I need to not die?  First aid, GPS(I have a garmin handheld), food, water, etc?

I am going with 2 friends so 3 people total which should help distribute the weight for the trip a bit.  We are currently planning on bringing water filters(any suggestion on brands would help) and 4-6L of water each.  Food is going to be nuts, dried fruit, and some ""just add boiling water"" meals.  Aiming to bring about 3000cal each of food and then a hand full of powerbars/cliff bars.  I have a very inexpensive jetboil that I am worried will not fare well at 14k ft.

I also will be carrying ~15-20lbs of camera equipment with me, that will be in addition to my food/water/clothing.

I would go it alone but my hiking experience in the UK is fairly limited (been on many many hikes in other countries though) and I don't drive making it difficult to get to and from each peak (obviously willing to chip in more than my share for gas) plus hiking's always fun with more than one :)

If anyone is interested in teaming up with me this summer for the challenge, send me a message and we can work something out!

61,Good hiking shoes for a heavy-set guy?,"6'3"", 260lb, getting into long walks (upwards of 5 hours of moderate speed walking) as well as some light hiking at least 4 days a week. My previous job really took its toll on my joints and feet, so I need some good, light hiking shoes, but I don't know where to start looking.

I am a neutral pronator, so I don't really need any medial support (I tried the Merrel ""Outright Inferno"" hiking boots in a nearby shop and it had a lot of medial support--I am not sure if all Merrell's have this). Not that this is relevant, but I read a lot of reviews praising the Vans Old Skool Pros, and after buying them and walking for a few hours in them a few days ago, my heels and the balls of my feet were aching like crazy, which is why I need proper (light) hiking boots.

66,Let's do better to educate new hikers (aka please don't blast your music while hiking in wilderness areas),"First off, I'll start this off by admitting that I'm venting here in part because I didn't say anything to the actual group. I don't go into the wilderness to be confrontational with other people, but I really wish I had said something. 

Anyway, I don't get to hike much these days, especially not in the desert which I love, but I got the chance to do a two hour hike in the beautiful Guadalupe Mountains National Park on Saturday. The particular spot is also in or extremely close to a designated National Wilderness Area. It was a moderately busy trail that day, and I was seeing people every ten or twenty minutes, mostly people returning from a full-day hike of Guadalupe Mountain itself. After I'd made it as far as my schedule allowed, I'm descending late in the afternoon back to my car. I can hear this muffled music rising up from below me. I can hear it for about ten minutes before I see the source, getting louder and louder (it's a steep trail with a lot of switchbacks). I'm pretty close to the trailhead at this point, so I'm expecting that it's some folks who don't get outdoors enough to really understand the ethic of wilderness. You know, maybe teenagers out for a jaunt who don't really hike much. I was young and dumb too, so whatever. But as the music gets louder, I see below me that it's two guys in full on backpacking mode, probably late 20s or early 30s. They've got all the nicest, newest gear and then some, plus of course a giant bluetooth speaker blasting dance music. 

**Here's my point**: as more and more people enjoy our wild places, we need to do better to educate newcomers and fellow outdoor enthusiasts. Maybe those guys were just assholes, but I actually don't think so. They had all the kit, but I got the sense they were new to backpacking. My point is that I feel like I'm the one who really screwed up by not saying anything. Hopefully it had simply never occurred to these guys that blasting music was inappropriate in a National Park. But I didn't speak up, and I wish I had. So I plan to do better in the future, and I hope y'all will too.",hiking,1523865839,kepleronlyknows,69,5,True,2018-04-16

81,My current hiking boots have injured my toenails on both big toes. Budget suggestions for replacements (Sub-$200 preferably?),"I currently have a pair of KEEN hiking boots that I got on the cheap. They felt great and I thought they WERE great until I took a long hike (&gt;6 miles) and after some downhills one of my toenails was tender and bruised. Luckily I didn't lose it, but even with them cut as short as possible, a few months later I tried another long hike and basically limped through it as both big toes were getting injured.

I need some help here with two things:

1. What did I do wrong in choosing these shoes? They felt like they were the right size (my toes both had a thumb of space at the end, like with running shoes) but every time I go downhill, no matter how tightly they're laced, my toes are pressing up against the front of them.

2. What brand or shoe would you recommend I replace these with? $200 is my max because I'm on a pretty strict budget. I don't care if they're branded towards men or women. Water-resistant is a must, a lot of the trails I hike have streams and I'm not the most coordinated and slip in often while hopping rocks. If I was better coordinated I'd honestly just hike in my running shoes!

It had some scrambling but did not require any vertical climbing, ice climbing, belaying or asending. My friend has done some guided hiking in guatemala, a few volcanos but nothing technical

Can anybody who has done this mountain or hiked in this area give us some advice? 


Is this a good time of year to do the mountain? 

Would you advise us to attempt the mountain given our experience level? And if not what other summits or multi day hikes can we attempt in the area would you recommend? 

What route would you advise we try? I have read Ingraham Glacier Direct, Disappointment Cleaver, or the Emmons Glacier are good for begineers. 

What specific skills would you advise we need? 
Do we need to book camp sites for our tent in advance? Or can we wild camp? 

Do we NEED a guide? Bearing in mind that it will be a highly popular route i imagine at this time of year. If we need a guide we would not attempt the summit as it is not in our price range. 

Where can we go for up to date weather information buy maps and mountain saftey advice before we set off in any park?

The latter option is pretty ambitious IMO, so I would have to get a lot of input (hopefully even from you guys) before seriously considering it.  This includes ruling in options, as well as ruling out enough for the trip to be realistic.

One of the key deciding factors, I think, will be time, seeing as I can get to where I want in West Virginia fairly quickly.  That alternative can be done over a long weekend.

Because I was using low hiking shoes I thought they were the problem, so I bought some quality high boots for the next hike a year later. But this didnt solve it at all, and I almost stranded in the middle of nowhere, being unable to walk much further. Last year I went on day hikes, so I could easily take some days of if it happened again. I had to take rest in between, because it started to hurt a bit after 2 days of hiking.

- If the problem is causes by overpronation, wil using insoles solve the problem? (I have quite a bit of overpronation)

I'll be flying in and out of San Francisco the last week of June and I'll have about 5-6 days to do some hiking. I'd definitely like to visit Pinnacles, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon NP. I'd also like to go back to Yosemite if I have time, but I've already been there &amp; I don't want to squeeze too much in.

Here's what I'm thinking...

**1 day in Pinnacles NP**

Hikes I'm considering: 

* Bear Gulch Trail

* High Peaks Trail

**3 or 4 days in Sequoia &amp; Kings Canyon NP**

Hikes I'm considering: 

* Marble Falls

* Mobius Arch Loop Trail

* Moro Rock Trail

* Mist Falls Trail

* Paradise Valley Trail

**1 day in Yosemite**

* A long hike like Cloud's Rest (my last visit to Yosemite I did: Mirror Lake, Vernal/Nevada Falls, Lower Yosemite Falls, Bridalveil Falls)

I'd really appreciate your feedback on this itinerary &amp; I'd like to know if I'm overlooking any hikes you'd recommend (including ones outside of the national parks).

Most hiking is mentally easy, one foot in front of the other, follow the trail. But when there are no trials, the hike is much more of a mental challenge. Every single step had to be thought about - where to go, what to avoid, how to step. It's a completely different type of exploring.

Find a trail-less area near you and check it out. I'll definitely delve more into Minnear and keep exploring.

I have solo backpacking adventure round the UK, Asia and New Zealand starting in May.

I bought myself some new hiking boots ; http://www.openair.co.uk/images/berghaus-hillwalker-ii-gtx-walking-boots-womens-p1486-10956_image.jpg 

After the first few walks to break them (a mild few hours hike) in I noticed a lot of pressure on my Achilles only on my left leg until the pressure seemed to be getting worse and by the end of the hike it turned into a limp.

Now every time I put the boots on and walk for a short period of time its starts to throb up again. Its not a sharp pain or a muscular pain and seems to come from the bottom of heel instead from calf.

Now my trip is coming very quickly and the problem is still here. Is it because the boots aren't broke into enough? 
Why is it only one leg if its the boots it surely would be both legs?
I don't really want to replace the boots as they weren't a cheap pair and money is spare for a 23 year old.
Any advice would be great.

-Zion (combine with Vegas for a few days as that is where we will fly into). This may be a better fit for an early spring/fall trip though 

-Smoky Mountains (would drive)

-Adirondack (would drive, not a national park but have heard great things)

I've been hiking for a little while now - I started back at the start of the year when my work colleague told me about the time he climbed Mera Peak!!

I was so enthusiastic about this, that I bought mediocre gear shortly after, and have been climbing the mountains in my state ever since.

So I've been doing this since January - But now I want to hone my skills...Or more so, create skills that I haven't previously touched.

After reading ""Summit 8000"" I was inspired to follow suit. Learn how to climb, learn roping skills, learn ice pick skills, navigation skills, etc...

I'm in some super form of enthusiasm and I want to start doing shit!

My question finally...

* Seeing as I want to climb bigger and bigger mountains (in the summer and snow) - What steps should I take to get there?

I'm kind of looking for a checklist of skills or something to go through, in hopes of gaining the skills I need for a climb like Mera Peak.

39,Zion Hop Valley hike question,"We're going hiking and camping for a couple days in Zion along Hop Valley and La Verkin Creek. We always bring our own water filtration systems (Sawyer Mini) to minimize weight, I also carry iodine purification tables for backup (In rare instance I've filtered and purified). I read on the Zion site that Hop Valley water consumption isn't safe for humans due to cattle grazing.  Is it wrong to assume filtering and purifying the water makes it drinkable? This is our first time encountering a hike that goes through cattle land with contaminated water.
Thanks for any info!

From the site:
&gt; ... The water in Hop Valley is unsafe for human consumption due to cattle activity...

**Update:**

This is the official response I got from Zion, it's vague enough that I assume they are just using a blanket statement to prevent liability; I did ask if filtering makes it fine. I am thinking we'll just bring enough water to avoid having to refill during the Hop Valley section.


&gt; Hello, 
&gt; 
&gt; You should not get any water out of Hop Valley due to it being an area that holds cattle for some of the year.  You can get water out of La Verkin Creek or Beatty Spring.

40,Hiked in the Laurel Highlands this weekend. Snow PSA,"Trails still had 6-8 inches of snow which we were not prepared for at all. We did the 653 trail head to the Grindle Ridge camp site which is about 5.5 miles and it was brutal. The wood was all frozen at the sites, the Adirondacks had 4-8 inches of snow in them. Getting a fire started took about an hour and a half and the temps were hovering around 20 or so.

I think we prepared for the weather somewhat, what we didn't prepare for was the difficulty the snow added to the hike. We've done this hike several times (I recommend it if you are in the area) and it isn't a terrible hike. But add walking in the snow to it and it became nearly unbearable.

53,Dealing with Leukotape adhesive,"I use Leukotape to prevent blisters, it works like a dream for me. Except - when I take the tape off the roll both sides are sticky because the adhesive from the tape that was on top sticks to the top side. So then my socks stick to the tape. Body glide type products seems to reduce, but not eliminate this effect.

How do other people deal with this? Or did I get a bad roll and this is not common? I'll probably try rubbing alcohol the next time I tape up, but I worry that will soak through the tape and reduce the adhesion where I need it, on my feet.

&gt;Here we go with that super important info, again. UDOT IS CONSIDERING A PLAN TO PAVE THE LITTLE COTTONWOOD CANYON TRAIL. You know the saying, ""when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail?"" Well, UDOT has a transportation problem in LCC and every alternative looks like a road, including paving the LCC/Quarry Trail from mouth to Tanner Flat. Because of some funds available to assist with transit needs in ""recreation hot spots,"" UDOT is analyzing alternatives for transit in LCC and has money to spend. And, in this case, that's where the rubber meets trail, as the canyon bottom, at a cost of over $10mil, is being considered for a paved trail.


&gt;This meeting is the ONE OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC COMMENT BY THE COMMUNITY. You must be there, TAG YOUR FRIENDS who should be, too. Let's make it clear to UDOT and others that we want MORE TRAILS IN LCC to accommodate more users and types of use. Share widely. Will you be there?

34,help narrowing down hiking boot selection,"**About Me:**

Female, 20s, day hiking primarily around northern california and the central coast, usually wear 8-8.5 US/39-40 EU I broke my ankle in September of last year, am planning a trip to the Canadian rockies, and I'd like to be able to go on a multi-day hike with some gear at some point, which is why I'm in the market for some boots.

Currently wear a pair of [Keen Oakridge](https://www.keenfootwear.com/variant/?pid=W-OAKRIDGE&amp;dwvar_W-OAKRIDGE_color=1015363) sz 8.5 that I bought before doing a ton of research. They're fine, pretty comfortable, give me good grip when I'm scrambling on things. I do think they're too wide for my feet, and I have gotten blisters before (and it hopefully wasn't a sock problem as I wear wool typically) from my foot sliding forward. At least I think that was the cause because the blisters were near the toes on the ball of my foot.

**What I've Already Done:**

I went to REI last night to try some on, and the employee helping me sized me (just below an 8, so I should probably look at 8.5 boots), said my foot was a normal width at the ball but thin at the heel, and told me I had a low-volume foot.

Initially I went to REI to try the [Lowa Renegade](https://www.lowaboots.com/womens/hiking/renegade-gtx%C2%AE-mid-ws?color=Red), but she immediately said those wouldn't work because they're too high volume (lol she wouldn't even let me try them on). I still want to try them on, as some sole inserts could maybe eat some volume if that was an issue. 

The employee gave me the [Oboz Bridger](https://obozfootwear.com/products/womens-bridger-mid-waterproof), [La Sportiva Trango TRK](https://www.sportiva.com/women-s/women-s-footwear/trango-trk-gtx-womens.html), [Vasque Talus](http://www.vasque.com/USD/product/womens-footwear/talus-ud-bungee-cord-purple-07419), [Salomon X Ultra 3](https://www.salomon.com/us/product/x-ultra-3-mid-gtx-w.html?article=398688). Of these, my toes hit the front of the Oboz when going downhill so I kind of counted those out. They felt good otherwise, except I think the heel is kinda wonky (sort of feel like I'm going to fall backwards), but that's probably something one would get used to. The Vasque were very comfortable and fit well, except the lacing eyelets (not true eyelets) pressed on the sides of my feet weird. The employee said they probably wouldn't hold up to any backpacking if I'd ever do that, which I'm not sure is true, but if it is, that makes me nervous to try any other full leather boot. I did not like almost anything about the Salomons. The Trangos fit the best by far--no foot slipping forward and a good heel lock. However they're totally synthetic, and there is this very hard part behind the heel that I'm unsure would break in. The plasticky outsides make me question the durability, but so far those were the best.

**My Questions:**

In searching online, there seems to be a difference in ""hiking boot"" (day hikes, less durable, less expensive) and ""backpacking boot"" (overnights, more durable, more expensive). Is it really that important to have one over the other? For example, if I ever plan to backpack, should I definitely get backpacking boots ($$$)? Or would my hiking boots suffice on a backpacking trip occasionally?

How do I compare between brands? Some brands have SO MANY mid hikers. For instance, I like the Trangos, but La Sportiva also makes the Blade, Stream, etc. Are these just different styles or are there ""levels"" of mid hiking boots (beginner, intermediate) that I should be paying attention to or making note of?

How do I find out what brands would be good for my foot shape and volume? I know Merrell's are usually thin and Keen's wide, but there are so many brands and so many shoes and brick and mortar stores only carry so many styles of each brand.

Should I stay away or run towards full leather? Gore-Tex? I see myself doing stream crossings occasionally, but I'm not sure if it's worth sacrificing the breathability? How do I truly know if I need a high or mid boot?

Aside from the Lowa Renegades and the La Sportiva Trangos, I am interested in the [Asolo Thyrus](http://www.asolo-usa.com/thyrus-women-s-brown-sugar.html), [Scarpa Kailash](https://www.scarpa.com/kailash-gtx-womens-15), [Vasque Breeze III](http://www.vasque.com/USD/product/womens-footwear/breeze-iii-gtx-red-brn-olive-07189), and the [Hoka One One Tor](https://www.hokaoneone.com/women-hiking/tor-ultra-hi-waterproof/1008335.html). And maybe the [Mammut Comfort Tour](https://us.mammut.com/p/3020-04820-0958/comfort-tour-mid-gtx-surround-women/). If anybody has any experience with finding boots for a similar foot type or raving or awful reviews for any of the above boot, I'd love to hear them.

I'm trying to plan a hiking trip in July, but unlike recent years i'm a bit stuck on deciding where i should go. My biggest problem is that i hate crowds, i don't mind seeing people along the trail but i don't want to have other groups in my sights at all time.

-Mountaineous (height differences of at least 500m)

-Relatively calm in the summer

-situated in Europe (i don't have the budget to move much further)

-Wild camping allowed or tolerated if you're discreet

We’ve tried rain boots, but they don’t support her on the hills and they’re not made for that kind of stress and we end up replacing them.

I don’t want expensive shoes; these won’t even last a year, her feet grow so fast. I’m thinking twenty dollars? I don’t even have a reference for price point, so if that’s too cheap, please correct me.

Unfortunately, In that decade I've noticed the quality significantly and consistently decline. My most recent pair I bought about 6 months ago and the tongue of the shoe and parts of the soles are already delaminating and requiring repair (which is the exact problem I have with every model of Merrell shoe I've ever bought). 10 years ago the shoes could last me a few years, then maybe 1.5 years, now they last less than a year.

I've tried Keens in the past, and don't like the fit and also feel like they fall apart very quickly similar to Merrels. What else is out there?

I wasn't technically hiking, I was fly fishing - in a brushy canyon in Northern CA - I walked down to the creek from a highway in an area with no clearly marked hiking trails.  On the way down, I was following a moderately worn foot path.  Got to the water, fished downstream, and as it started to get a little dark, tried to find my way back.  This particular creek is pretty fast water, slipper rocks, with lots of vegetation on the banks - so walking back up the stream wasn't the easiest option - although in hindsight, probably the best.  Anyhoo, I got out of the creek and immediately found another foot path - I thought great, here I go.  Not so fast - this one petered out fairly quickly, and I found myself without a reasonable way back to the highway - lots of thick trees, thorny brush, impenetrable.  

I screwed around for a bit looking for a way through the crap, and after maybe 15 minutes and several bad directional decisions, I found a way - it was tough, scratched my hands up, and probably put tons of pin holes in my waders.

Now my question for the group - how do you track yourself in situations like this?  I've looked at Gaia, and I see where  you can create your own tracks - I think this is what I'm looking for, but I'm not sure  - I assume this will work in the absence of trails?  Can I hit the record 'button' to track how I get to the creek, save that, then pull it back up to navigate back to the trail I created?  Will all of this work with no cell coverage?

The end of this hike is very serene, a frozen waterfall tucked away in this little high elevation alcove in the side of the mountain. There was a light snowfall and it was an otherwise perfect day.
       Then this guy started flying his very loud drone. It sounded like a tree full of cicadas next to a megaphone. After about 5 minutes of buzzing I walked over to the dude flying it and said basically, “Hey man, people come out here to get away from the city and noise and we’re trying to enjoy the waterfall and the snow. I can’t tell you how to live but it’s very inconsiderate to fly a drone out here.” 
      The guy who wasn’t flying the drone spoke with me and was pretty dismissive saying that they’re doing the same thing, trying to get into nature and I shouldn’t tell them what to do, etc. but they did stop flying the drone.

15,Soliciting recommendation for a pair of waterproof boots for day trips in Olympic National Park in March/April,"So, I'm about to go wander around the ONP at a mildly shitty time of year (last weekend in March and first week in April). I'm not a frequent hiker mind you, I'm a glorified farm hand and as such I'm outside a lot and farmers are less inclined to keep going outside when I have time off. (At least that's what I keep telling myself.) Now, normally I wear something that drains quick and dries easy but from what I've gathered I should go with something waterproof given the amount of rainfall and variable temperatures in the ONP. Feel free to correct me if I'm totally off-base here.

Budget: Could go up to $200 but the less the better. I would totally throw down an obscene amount of money on a pair of Akus or some other crazy gucci hiking brand but, well, it's a bad idea.

Size: Somewhere between an 11C and an 11.5C on the Brannock scale. I could probably fit in a 10.5 Salomon or Merrel but I'm usually better off with an 11. IDK if this is useful sizing is arbitrary as fuck. 

Use: Day hikes, gallivanting around tide pools, general wandering. Not doing anything particularly crazy or going off-trail. Thinking waterproof, and a high cut to accentuate the waterproof aspect. 

 I don't think any of what I have would suffice but I'm going to throw it all up here in case I'm totally and utterly wrong and someone can berate me over my choices and tell me to not spend money:

Alico hiking boots (no lining). With beeswax I can get them fairly waterproof but I don't think it's temperate rainforest levels of waterproof. 

Salomon mid-rise w/goretex liner: Mid is too low even for mud season around here (NY) so I'm going to guess the PNW would kick their asses, plus the waterproofing isn't doing so good, probably because I have no clue what model is and I got them for $40 used. 

Merrel Moab ventilators: Comfy and they dry quickly but I'm not so sure that's going to be good enough for this.

I welcome any and all recommendations and/or insults to my intelligence for my amazing plan to go actively searching for a worse mud season. ",hiking,1520478762,SaintZvlkx,2,1,True,2018-03-07

There are also two recent hikes where the unit took almost 30 minutes to get a gps fix before finally gettin a lock.

Now in a few months I'll be going to Africa for a Kilimandjaro hike and I'm wondering if it might be worth it to upgrade to the newer 64s model, or just to wait for it to die eventually (hopefully not in Africa).

Besides Bluetooth and Garmin Connect (I already have a Garmin Fenix, so this is a plus for me) I don't see anything really groundbreaking in the newer model. Although it would certainly be really nice if I could get tracks on/off the device without having to connect it to a computer.

I was considering going  to Germany this summer to hike the E-5 long distance hiking route from Oberstdorf to Merano in Italy. It looks fantastic, and understand it is very popular for Germans, I had just a few questions on it:

-How easy is the route finding on the E-5? That is, is it well sign posted and it is usually clear which way you have to go? I've done plenty of hiking, but never one where the trail wasn't easy to follow. I wouldn't want to lose the trail and get lost in the Alps.

-Would it be a problem doing this hike not speaking German? I'd try to learn a little before coming and bring a phrasebook.

-Would there be an issue finding places to stay in the mountain huts if I went in the middle of the summer and traveled independently? I know it would be easier with a group tour but I really don't like them. 

Any other thoughts or feedback on the E-5 would be most welcome.

Never been hiking in Utah before but I'm planning a trip with my girlfriend from April 13-24, flying in and out of Vegas and driving up. I've seen some awesome posts on most of the Utah parks kicking around r/hiking so I figured I'd come here for some sage advice from you guys and ensure I'm not missing out on too much! We're both trail/long distance runners with hiking experience primarily looking for moderate-to-difficult day hikes, but totally open to suggestions you may have.

Any accommodations/food/entertainment recommendations you have would also be greatly appreciated!

* Notional Driving Route: https://goo.gl/maps/SF5eHopWvXm

**One - Drive from Las Vegas to Springdale, hit up Zion and find a nice afternoon hike, stay in Springdale overnight (BnB/Hotel). Could do 2 days here.**
* -My top picks for Zion: Observation Point or Hidden Canyon on our way back down from Observation Point (less traveled, some scrambling here... is repelling a necessity here?). West Rim Trail (17 miles - good hike for Day 2, maybe?) or Angel's Landing / Narrows Trailhead, which seem to be highly recommended but busier trails. Would be cool to float down the Narrows, though. Emerald Pools trail is apparently incredible, too. Lots of options here so I'm having a tough time narrowing it down to a two-day itinerary!

**Two - Drive from Springdale to Escalante, spend 2 days touring Escalante.**
* -My top picks for Escalante: Lower Calf Creek Falls, Devil's Garden (arches, hoodoos, 2-4 hour hike time, can probably do Lower Calf Creek and Devil's Garden in one day?). Spooky and Peekaboo would be sweet if we plan a full day hike here. We could also check out Anasazi State Park in Boulder along our way and enjoy the nice drive out on Hell's Backbone road between Escalante and Boulder as well.

**Three - Drive from Escalante to Canyonlands, Maybe 1 day at Canyonlands?**
* -Totally up for suggestions here. Lots of good stuff. Grand View Point, Mesa Arch, Confluence Overlook, Horseshoe Canyon, Upper Salt Creek... or Salt Creek Canyon and Murphy Trail, which are less traveled and 20-30 mile routes and might make a great day trip. I need to narrow this down and need your help here!

* -Should probably eat at Ray's Tavern 'cause it looks delicious. :)

**Four - Drive from Canyonlands to Moab. Spend 2 days in Arches.**
* -Popular hikes in Arches: Windows, Double Arch, Delicate Arch, Landscape Arch and Balanced Rock. Devils Garden/Dark Angel hike seems cool (https://modernhiker.com/hike/hike-the-devils-garden-arches-national-park/), Eye-of-the-Whale Arch and Klondike Bluffs are less traveled and might be cool.

* Correct me if I'm wrong here, but it seems like Arches is more of a driver-oriented park, not many ""day"" trips to be had so it might be cool to just cruise around and see what we can find?

**Five - Drive from Moab back to Vegas.**

17,Southern CO and Southern UT trip suggestions,"Hi All, 

Im planning on making a trip west to CO and UT and was hoping for some input. 

I plan on doing this trip in early August. 

I want to use Grand Junction as a starting point for Arches or Canyonlands. Not sure which one to do. 

Spend a day at Capitol Reef next and camp somewhere around CR. 

Next I want to use St George as a basecamp for Zion. Next I was thinking of doing either Bryce or going further south to the Grand Canyon.
Which one should I pick?

Following that I want to go back to CO for a trip to Black Canyon of the Gunnison and stay at a hotel nearby that has natural hot springs. 

Following that I will return to the weary farmlands of my home in IA. 

Any suggestions or input would be very appreciated.

I've only recently gotten into hiking. I bought a pair of Corcoran leather boots. I know it's probably not the most conventional choice in footwear but I really like a boot that's long like that for the ankle support and the traction is fantastic. 

When I put boot on my toes don't touch the end, overall the boot is snug and feels great to walk and stand in. But when I'm going up hill the heel feels really really tight, it's the weirdest thing to me. I went on a small hike yesterday and my heels hurt a little bit after. This is only the second time I've worn them out, do they just need to break in? Are they too small? I don't wear boots like ever, do long boots just do this?

I wore boots for about 18 hours straight, tightened pretty tight with thick socks and all day I thought about how comfortable and nice it was to have everything fit so snugly (so much so I left them on longer than I usually do.) 

When I took them off when I got home, I had some crazy indents in my skin from where the boot, sock, and some of the jeans that got tucked in were pushing on my skin. 

I freaked out- thought I cut off blood to my feet all day, and spent five minutes poking them with a toothpick in various areas making sure I retained the ability to feel on the affected area (I did, and was being paranoid.)

That being said, the indents were pretty deep into the skin and very detailed. Most notable halfway down my shin, where I ran the laces around the back of the boot and tied it tight. There wasn’t any pain however, or itching, or irritation. I’m new to this and don’t want to accidentally get my feet amputated.

12,Day hike suggestions for Zion and the Grand Canyon in mid-May,"Trigger Warning: Really long post asking questions :)

I am turning 40 in May and have decided to do a destination birthday out west (I live in NY and 4-season hike in the Catskills, the Adirondacks, the Whites, etc.). We're planning to fly to Vegas in the morning of Thursday, May 10th, Drive somewhere near Zion, check into an Airbnb or hotel, and then spend the next 4.5 days hiking in Zion until the North Rim Trail opens on May 15th, and then do 3 days at the Grand Canyon.

On Day 1 after we check in, we were thinking of doing a laid-back sunset hike which we can probably start around 5PM (sunset is at 8:30). Any suggestions for this? We might hang around and enjoy the stars and then headlamp hike back to our car and head back.

We then have Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday to hike more in Zion, and we'll be driving to the North Rim Monday night. The longest hike I have done is the Devil's Path which is 24 miles and 9,000 elevation gain and I did it in 15 hours (chill pace), so I think I can handle any of the typical day hikes at Zion. In fact, we may have to do a couple of the typical day hikes to fill up the day, or even do some that are normally considered backpacking hikes. We also are all comfortable with level 4 scrambles and crazy heights. That said, since we'll be hiking for a week straight, I don't want to murder my body everyday, so alternating between hard and more relaxed days probably makes sense.

We are looking at the following hikes of interest (note we are not sure we want to wade in water but would consider it if it is worth it; also I think a lot of those hikes are closed or require permits during the spring because of high water levels. We're also thinking of canyoneering one day on a guided tour):

West Rim Trail (17 miles)  
Angel's Landing (5.4 miles)  
Observation Point (8 miles)  
Zion Narrows (16 miles)  
La Verkin Creek Trail (11 miles)  
Kolob Arch (14 miles)  
Weeping Rock (0.4 miles)  
Emerald Pools Trail (3 miles)  
Riverside Walk (2 miles)  
Canyon Overlook Trail (1 mile)  
Watchman Trail (3 miles)  
Hidden Canyon (3 miles)  
I'm guessing we can't do the Narrows or the Subway in May except maybe on a guided canyoneering trip  

We then head to accommodations near the North Rim. We have choices here. Since we only have 3 days to spend, would you recommend 2 days at the North Rim, or 2 days at the South Rim? Note that on the last day, we'll have to leave before sunset to catch our flight home.  Ideally, we'd like a hike that goes down to the river and all the way back up.

We appreciate anyone's insight regarding the above questions, and also the following:

22,Question: Mountaineering boots or trail runners for crossing the Alps?,"I'm crossing the Alps this summer (https://www.oase-alpin.de/en/trips/hikes/e5-from-oberstdorf-to-meran.html) and would love some input on footwear.

1) Boots - I have the Salewa GTX Crow boots, which are heavy, tough (one might say clunky) goretex mountaineering boots (https://www.salewa.com/crow-gore-tex-womens-shoes-00-0000061329). I bought them for glaciers and mountaineering.

2) Trailrunners - I have just ordered a pair of Altra Lone Peak 3.5s, because they were recommended by so many people here and in other hiking forums as comfortable shoes suitable even for technical terrain (https://www.altrarunning.com/women/womens-lone-peak-35)

Which footwear is the most appropriate for crossing the Alps? 

Whenever I've hiked in the Alps before I've worn boots, but never these monolithic mountaineering boots. They're so heavy that I'm worried the ankle support and durability will be outweighed by their literal weight. Also, because they're GTX, my feet won't breathe.

On the other hand, all the recommendations I see for the Altra Lone Peaks come from US backpackers so I don't know how applicable those recommendations are for European trails? I'm sure it's good advice but does anyone have any experience hiking in the Alps for several days at a time in trailrunners?

Is there a wild card that I'm missing? I could return the Altras and buy some other shoes if there's something better out there.",hiking,1519839334,octocuddles,17,3,True,2018-02-28

I'm taking a week-long trip to Switzerland with a large group, we'll be touring the country and visiting cities and scenic overlooks.

I'm in no way an avid hiker, nor do I plan on doing anything too strenuous in Switzerland. But we will be doing a ton of walking, and the weather will most likely make for snowy, icy, and muddy ground both in the cities and on trails. 

I have flat feet as is, so I'm looking for something comfortable, warm, and light, as I don't want to take up a lot of room in my suitcase with bulky boots. 

Also it would be nice if they were somewhat stylish as it would mean I could wear them out in the city too and not have to bring an extra pair of shoes. But that's less important of course.

I just had a couple questions that I seem to be having trouble finding answers to elsewhere online.  I'm heading to Zion in the fourth week of March for two days.  I'm thinking of hiking Angel's Landing on day 1, and then the East Rim Trail to Observation Point on day 2.

Questions:
If I want to avoid the crowds by getting up very early, can I just drive into the park and find a parking lot?  The first shuttle says it is at 8am, but I think that is too late to get started.

Which parking lot is best for Angel's Landing?  The map says to park at the Grotto, but will I be able to park there?  How early do these parking lots fill up? Can I enter the park before sunrise?  I have the same question for the Weeping Rock trailhead to start day 2.

Are there other hikes you would do other than the above two?

Do I need a permit for either of these hikes?  If so, can I get it online before hand, or do I need to show up and get it at the park gate?

The weather seems to be all over the place in late March.  AccuWeather has a low of 32F and a high of nearly 70F.  I have two sets of hiking boots - one for warm weather and one for cold weather and wet conditions.  Which should I bring?  I'll be flying from London, so I won't be bringing both!

47,Need advice regarding pace,"Hi Guys, 
I've a lot of experience of hiking and being outdoors but I need advice regarding walking pace. 
I'm currently planning a hike through Denmark. I live in southern Sweden and intend on getting to Germany, around 360km (224 miles) in about ten days. Really what I'm wondering is whether this is like practically possible at all or if I need to postpone the hike to when I have more time to do it. 

Doing the math, 36km/22 miles a day should be no problem. But my parents want me to live in Hostels and B&amp;Bs. Thus I can't divide the distances this neatly and won't always have all daylight time to walk (depending on their check-in routines). What I'm worried about is having to walk 44-42-36-38 km on day 5-9. 

Some background. I'm 16 and fit, I run 8km three times a week and do some weight training twice a week. On multiple occasions have I done around 20 mile one day hikes with minor difficulty (it's somewhat exhausting and I feel it in the legs). Psychologically I can endure quite a lot, but I'm certainly no Navy SEAL. 

Anecdotal Background (read if you want)
Last year I attempted to walk around about 150km (~90 miles) in just about 2.5 days. I managed about 20 miles in 7 hours the first (half) day, around 35 the second day (then I had to take the bus in order to get to my Hostel in time) and, after having failed only lingered 22 the last. This while wearing about a 10 kg (22 pounds) backpack, which I'm aiming for this time as well. 
It was not pleasant (I was in severe pain at the end of the second day). 

So if anyone has some experience and could tell me now that this undertaking is bound to fail, please tell me now before my planning gets to elaborate.

If you watch these videos, what of the following do you look for most:

* length (do you prefer them around 5 minutes or more like the lenght of a short TV show episode around 20-30 mins)

* scenery shots/talking shots

* discussion of gear and how it's holding up

* discussion of the difficulty/other aspects of the trail itself

* vloggy chat stuff that shares the personality of the vlogger/walk and talks

* high quality videography that only show certain segments of the trail vs amateur but consistent recording 

* video title (e.g. would you be more likely to watch ""Crossing the Alps Day 3"" or ""Almost Fell off a Cliff on the Alps!"" or ""Using xyz gear on the E5 across the Alps"")

* gender/nationality/other identifying aspects of the vlogger

For me, I quite like long vloggy videos that take you along for the ride (my favourite is Homemade Wanderlust), but sometimes I just want short matter-of-fact reviews of the trail or the gear.

5,Good backpack for short range hikes,"The family just acquired approximately 6000 acres. And I’m looking to begin hikes around some of the area. But I’m wondering what the best backpack is for the money, because I want to buy something that lasts, but doesn’t break the bank. 

I don’t need something giant because it’s not that far of walk home, so lighter/smaller backpack. 

Needs to be big enough for my take down rifles, Ruger 10/22 and Keltec Sub2000. And preferable a place for my 10mms, but not necessarily needed because i can just get a shoulder holster

Have some room for water bottles, a small lunch, and a small first aid kit (or other things that people recommend) 

And preferably able to be ordered from Amazon since I’m 3 hours away from the nearest city

So basically I’m just asking for advise for the best backpack in my situation. Any help is appreciated

I live in the US, so I could travel back there after Korea, but the programs I am interested in are in either Spain or Thailand (I haven't chosen yet).  

So I could either spend the 4 months in Korea before going directly to school, or in the US before school, or in either Spain or Thailand where either of the programs I'm interested in are located before beginning school in that country. Or I could spend the time in a neighboring area of any of those four places. 

So you all know I'm not a total schlub, I did a bicycle trek across (most of) the US, and I am eager for a long-distance voyage again, by foot (walk/run/hike), bicycle, kayak or otherwise. 

I'll post this in a number of subs that are centered on activities that I could spend up to 4 months doing.

Anyways, I'm just curious if anyone here has any suggestions. I am more interested in options that are completable in my time frame (not sections of one big thing), but I'm open to everything at the moment, and I'm open to all the listed locations equally. I'm aware of the more popular options, such as the Camino (which I'm not sure I'm interested in, tbh), or the AT (which I am unsure of with the time I have and the time it takes to complete it). 

Also, if I go with a hiking trip, I think I'll try my hand at a more minimalist style. Not extreme minimalism (yet), but something like 15-20 pounds.

I'm a little wigged out by the bears. (We don't have bears in NW Ohio, or hills for that matter). Probably because I'm really ignorant about them.

Are there areas where we should avoid because of known bear activity, or a place where we could get recent information on that sort of thing?

Ours are definitely not service animals, but they are well trained (they even carry their own water, snacks, and poo bags).

I am looking to get new hiking boots and I cannot get anything to fit me.I am in California (Palmdale) for job training and have been to the REI and dicks etc and all the shoes/ boots I have seen recommended don't seem to fit.
I have wide feet, about a 4e or so and wear insoles for my feet.

I have been wearing Rocky sv2 9 wide as my hiking and hunting boot and it was my daily wear when in the military. After 8 years they are almost dead. 

So I am looking for a replacement. I want a real all leather hiking boots like hanwags that will last forever and be a hunting off trail boot as well,however as there are no dealers here I thought i would get some light trail boot/shoe  that the expert hikers recommend just to use for the trails,keen, oboz etc.

The problem is, they all pinch my little toe. 
I bought a pair of keens that  felt ok on the store 10.5 but after wearing on a little hike still make my toe hurt like hell and actually feel a bit big size wise.i even got sole thick insoles for it and it hasn't helped.

What's funny is that if I take out the insole, and stand on it, I have plenty of room and the shoe appears to be wider than my Rocky boot by a decent amount. 

In the past i have worn the wide boat shoes and tennis shoes usually half size to a size larger and used the insoles and they worked ok but sucked for anything outdoors and don't last.  The only thing I can think is that not only do I have wide feet but that my little toe kind rolls to the side and maybe sticks up a little. So part of the problem might be height, and that the rounder toe of the Rockies gives it the height it needs and the boat shoes/ tennis shoes stretch a bit and the keens don't.

So are there any suggestions for what do do or try? Sadly there are only dicks and rei etc around here that I can see, i can't seem to find any small shops with an actual expert shoe fitter.

33,What does a good (solo) hiking movie look like?,"Hi fellow hikers!

First of all, my apologies if this becomes a long post. I feel like explaining how I came to this question. I also want to apologies as English is not my first language and although I try, there will be some mistakes.

In the last 7 years I went on a lot of solo long-distance hikes. Long distance for me means hiking more than a week. The  distance is relative, as you can't cover the same distance in the mountains as you would do inland, or on a coastal trial. I just wanted to get this out of the way before all thru-hikers start to one-up me. Believe me the PCT an At are on my list but at this time in my life I can only leave for 2 - (max) 3 weeks.

Anyway, I did trails all over Europe but never really returned back home with pictures or movies that would explain to outsiders what it is like to go on adventures like this. I didn't care at first, as for me it was a very personal thing. 

This changed 3 years ago.

I set the goal to make a movie that would give a clear answer to everyone who asked me why I leave on these solo trips. My answer until now has always been : because I like it a lot, and you should also try it. I want to just show them a movie that explains it better than words would be able to do.

I bought a second hand GoPro and invested in a Sony RX100 when leaving for a 3 week hike in Scotland. The idea was to make this trip a learning experience on how to film when hiking solo. Do experiments with framing, settings and different things like timelaps and slow motion effects.

I did come home that year with some interesting shots and learned what worked and did not work. Last year I left for Corsica (GR20) and committed to making the best movie possible. 

It actually changed how I hiked! I kept the story in mind, talked to a lot of passer-byes and at the end was quite happy with the result. But then on the day I left to the airport...I lost my camera. I blame the fact that I just got back from the mountains, and now was back in the rush that normal life is.

I was depressed for a week until I decided that it actually was not a lot different then previous trips : I loved every second of it but didn't come back home with the pictures or movies to proof it. Why should I care? But more importantly, it was another learning experience on how to make a hiking movie.

This brings us to 2018.

It's always at this time of the year that I start dreaming of my next adventure. I'm still in the dreaming phase but I'm slowly reaching the planning phase. I've currently decided on the [Walkers Haute route](https://www.thehikinglife.com/2010/10/chamonix-zermatt-walkers-haute-route/) and bought a new camera (sony RX100 m3).

This time, I will return home and create the movie I dream of making.

An additional note : I have a lot of movie editing experience, but somehow never combined both passions. 

Back to the original question :
What does a good (solo) hiking movie look like to you?
What are the things you can't explain about solo-hiking to other people?

I'm looking for all the inspiration there is, Youtube movies you like, movies you hate, experiments that you did that failed,.... anything really.



Thanks,
Twoon

3,Headed to Utah/Colorado/Arizona and looking for critique of my itenerary.,"Hey all, as the title says, I am headed out west for a 9ish day vacation of hiking and camping here coming up. I was hoping some people on here could take a look at the trails and campsites I plan on staying at and give it a thumbs up, tell me to avoid spots, or suggest slight modifications. I am in pretty good shape and fairly experienced in backpacking. I am doing this trip with my friend who is also fairly experienced. Without further ado here is my plan:

**Day 1**: Drive from Midwest to Denver (17ish hours). arrive, eat, smoke a j, go to sleep.

**Day 2**: drive from Denver to arches national park. Setting up camp at Devils Garden campground during the day and then heading to Delicate Arch trail for the sunset.

**Day 3**: leave devils garden and head to Zion National Park South Campground. Here we plan to set up shop again and then find an easy day hike (thinking emerald trail, but obviously open to suggestions.)

**Day 4**: Wake up at Zion and hike Angels landing early morning. Of course this is dependent on the weather cooperating, because I am not going to risk it if it is snowy/icy. After hiking AL, head to grand canyon and stay the night at Bright angel lodge.

**Day 5:** wake up and go on a backpacking trek into the grand canyon. (here is where I am hoping for the most advice as I have never been and couldn't find much on what the best backpacking trips are). We are starting at Kaibab trailhead and heading about 8 miles to bright angel campground for the night. 

**Day 6**: leave BA campground and hike to indian gardens camp. Stay the night here.

**Day 7**: leave Indian gardens camp and head back to bright angel trailhead (where our car is). Leave from bright angel back to Mob and camp again at Devils Garden. 

**Day 8**: head home.



**ALTERNATE** (if GC is easier/not as impressive/anything else): 
**Day 6**: hike from BA campground straight back to the trailhead (10 miles). camp at the car camping spot (Mather)

**Day 7**: leave Mather and head to Canyonlands NP. backpack to a back country spot to camp.

**Day 8**: head home

9,Looking for an online hiking buddy/mentor!,"Hello! 

I figured this may be a long shot, but I'll try it out here. I am looking for, as the title suggests, a buddy to mentor and help guide me as I venture back into the world of hiking. Not looking for someone to physically hike with me (unless we discover that we're in the same area... then maybe) but someone to chat with online, ask questions of, and get a little coaching. Basically, if I had a friend who was into this stuff, I'd be asking them to help me get going, but since I don't, I'm reaching out!

A little about me! A million years ago when I was a teenager, I was part of a Venture Crew. We went hiking all over the dang place, to include 50-80 mile backpacking trips. It was amazing and I have tons of excellent memories from those years... Philmont, Yosemite Falls, Ansel Adams Wilderness... ahhh those were the days! But then college happened, then marriage and kids happened, and I've come a long way from my glory days.

I'm ready to get back there now! Now I'm a whole different person in a totally different body, and I can't just plow my way through things like I did back then. I have aches, and knees, and restless sleep. Youth really is wasted on the young. I've been losing weight doing the keto diet, I had been working out with a personal trainer for about 4 months, and now I'm on my own. I'm about a third of the way to my weight loss goal and I'm very happy with the progress and pace I'm making with that.

My husband has stage 4 colon cancer, and just retired from the Army. We've settled in southern Colorado, and honestly, what better freaking place to pick up outdoor adventuring again? I'm ready to pick up the pace and get going again. I'm starting out with short day hikes, as I'm not quite acclimated here yet, and I am still a little wobbly after an ACL reconstruction I had on my knee about a year and a half ago. Totally rehabbed and cleared from PT, but it's going to take some conditioning and working up so I don't re-injure myself.

Here's my hiking bucket list, and what I need help working toward:

Hike a 14er here in Colorado, or multiple. My sister really wants to do it and I told her I'd do it with her if I'm able to.

Hike Half Dome (my dream since forever... I'm terrified of heights, but I can't stop thinking about doing it, have read up on it, have read trip reports like obsessively... I need to do it.)

Eventually, hike the John Muir Trail. PCT was on my wishlist but with my husband ill, I can't afford to be away from my family as long as hiking that would take. I think the JMT is a happy compromise that we could accommodate.

Get my boys into Scouts again and eventually (this will be at least 4-5 years) go back to Philmont with them, this time as an advisor.


I don't have a timeline for these things (sis wants to do the 14er this summer, but if I'm not physically ready, I won't join her. I can't hurt my dumb knee again.) I think it's more important to be really prepared for those types of hikes, and I need help learning about what I need to do to get there. I am NOT looking for professional or medical advice. Just a buddy. 

So... any takers? :D

I've been toying with an idea for a while about making an automatic checkin app, mostly as a side project that I hope would fund it's own costs and be a labour of love. 

I know there's hiker alert already. But my question is does someone wish that app does something that doesnt?

- Notify friend you're going on a hike, and share details in app about it or over sms

* App let's you record friends who do have the app or dont'

- If they do can send alerts via push notification, maybe a chat room(?) if they don't check in the app after the specified time

- If your friend doesn't respond in a set time (few min) then send sms

- Allow periodic checkins with optional gps positions via app or sms

My current backpack is shot, it has about a dozen holes and I've had it for about 8 years. I'm looking to get a new one, but I want one that I can use for any purpose and will remain durable - holding books for class, traveling overnight somewhere, or going on a day long hike.

16,Getting to backpack in Iceland at 19 years old with 3 of my closest friends and my brother. Gotta say I feel blessed,"Thought I’d share this story real quick. I’m an Eagle Scout and so is my brother, we’ve done tons of backpacking on the AT in the states along with a 200 mile trip with our dad. Needless to say backpacking is in our blood at this point. We both wanted to see the world in our own ways, we decided randomly one day that we were old enough to start our world journey and decided Iceland would be the place to start. We called up 3 of our friends and got them on board and in one month we earned enough money to travel on a tight budget by doing odd jobs like pressure washing. This past week we finally booked our plane tickets and even though we’re still $700 away from our end goal, it’s official we’re backpacking Iceland! We bought a go pro, drone, and a nice Nikon camera to film so if anyone would be interested in seeing the shots or a YouTube video just let me know.

Looking to get a good set of trekking poles. Would like relatively lightweight but doesn't necessarily need to be carbon fiber. I know that Leki will replace any bent/broken aluminium sections for life but their accessories are a bit pricey. Black Diamond only has a 1 year warranty. I don't mind buying from a smaller company (ZPacks, Gossamer, Locus Gear CP3, etc) but I want parts to be replaceable at a fair price. Am I correct that grips etc can all be replaced? What are thoughts re: cork vs a good synthetic foam? Carbon fiber vs aluminium? I'd like to be able to use these year round and on most any surface including concrete/asphalt and with or without warm winter gloves. We live in an area with true 4 seasons including quite a bit of snowfall. Will Leki rubber tips (particularly the angled Nordic style) work on other brands? Oh, I'll likely want to be able to use these with a shelter setup at some point. And I'm not very tall (in terms of figuring out size needed). Thanks so much in advance!!

41,Grand Canyon Honeymoon Hike,"(x-post from /r/grandcanyon/)Hello!  

My fiance and I are planning a hike in the Grand Canyon in late June for our honeymoon. We submitted our permit application on the 29th of February and are awaiting news of acceptance or not. The requested hike was based on a friend's recommendation made years ago of starting at Bright Angel and ending at Hermit's Rest. 3 days, 2 nights.  

I was just here to inquire about advice regarding the trail and advice regarding options should our permit be declined. Unfortunately, the date of our trip is pretty static. So I fear that this will make it less likely that our permit will be approved. However, we do still plan on going to the canyon and hiking regardless of the result of our application.  

We're both very active and in good shape. We're aware of the projected temperatures in the canyon during that time of year and are planning accordingly. We'll be packing 4l of water minimum with a sawyer squeeze and a bladder. I plan on researching where there are potable water sources on the trail too. I've already read that some can be radioactive and/or too salty. Given the heat and that we're only going to be hiking 3 days, it'll be easy to keep our packs light. We camp and hike quite often and are no strangers to the outdoors, but this will be our first desert hike.  

For those of you that are familiar, what would you recommend we do if we don't get our backcountry permit? We'd still like to hike and camp out for the duration if possible. We'd be parking a rental car at Bright Angel, so if we strayed too far we'd either need to loop around(preferably from a different trail) or catch a shuttle back.  

Also, aside from hats, clothing coverage, sunscreen, water and the other obvious tips, does anyone have any desert hiking insight that we should know before we go? Thanks!",hiking,1517624807,MercrediAlchemy,2,2,True,2018-02-02

I've tried a few padding/cushions during hikes but not all of them work during hiking: 

- they need to stay in place and not move around (therefore I avoid the type with toe ring such as https://www.amazon.com/Dr-Fredericks-Original-Metatarsal-Pads/dp/B01BMY4VN4/ref=sr_1_3_a_it?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1517502447&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=morton+padding), 

- they should not be bulky towards the toes (I have one which stays in place similar to this: https://www.amazon.com/ZenToes-Metatarsal-Supports-Metatarsalgia-Fracture/dp/B0716J6G8X/ref=pd_sbs_121_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B0716J6G8X&amp;pd_rd_r=TJ4PVJQAACAJ8Q8XS78A&amp;pd_rd_w=TZAyb&amp;pd_rd_wg=AX7mr&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=TJ4PVJQAACAJ8Q8XS78A, but add bulk between the shoe and the pink toe resulting in blisters),

- they need to be able to take a beating and not lose its cushioning power too quickly.

45,When to trek the Tour du Mont Blanc &amp; Haute Route,"Over the coming weeks we will be focusing our blog on 10 of the top frequently asked questions. What do people need to know before making the decision to come to this impressive environment and challenge themselves on one of our ‘Must do’ long distance trekking holidays, Tour du Mont Blanc &amp; the Walkers Haute Route.

I will start with one of the basics questions: 

When can you trek the Tour du Mont Blanc, Walkers Haute Route or Traverse of the Gran Paradiso &amp; what will the weather be like?

In short for the Tour du Mont Blanc mid-June until late September &amp; for the Walkers Haute Route &amp; Traverse of the Gran Paradiso mid-July until late September.

The European Alps are in the Northern hemisphere so December to April we have lots of snow &amp; the mountains that tower above Chamonix, Zermatt &amp; Courmayeur are a reserved for snowshoeing, skiing, ski touring &amp; winter mountaineering.

The snow starts to recede in the spring and the lower trails are accessible by May, if you are planning to arrive here at that time then it is possible to tailor make a series of Chamonix trails at lower altitude but the higher multi day routes are not accessible.

The Tour du Mont Blanc is possible from mid-June however you will come across a good deal of snow on the high cols &amp; shaded slopes which makes the route difficult &amp; potentially dangerous. If you are intending trekking at that time it is essential for you to carry the correct equipment with you, walking crampons, ice axe, walking poles. You also need the ability to move confidently on snow for large periods of time. The route tends to be snow free by early July however this can change each year &amp; the amount of snow on the route depends on how much snow we have had during the winter &amp; of course how warm spring has been. All accommodation &amp; transport is open from Mid-June to the end of September.

The Walkers Haute Route &amp; Traverse of the Gran Paradiso are different, both routes trek to a higher altitude up to &amp; over 3000m so trekking isn’t advisable until mid-July. Both routes are doable until late September. 

Weather-wise many clients ask what will it be like? In a word, changeable! This area of the Alps around Mont Blanc has its own micro-climate and during our trekking period we at MBT will experience all types of weather (sometimes in one day!) and it is not uncommon to have fresh snow on the trail in July &amp; August. You need to be prepared and have the correct clothing and equipment to protect you in poor weather. You also need to be prepared for warm weather, with a high factor sunscreen, sunglasses and head shade for those scorching days with breath taking views.

Average valley temperatures for Chamonix at 1100m, allow for temperature drop for altitude gain as the Cols at 2500m will be significantly cooler.

June-July
Min +7°C / +9°C

It's that time of year again where me and the crew start planning our annual hiking/camping expedition. Best time of the year in my book!

This year we are going to Mt. Rainier and wanted to send out a friendly request for tips and recommendations. 

A little bio on our group, we are all fit, experienced climbers, and will be traveling with no technical climbing gear. We will have spikes or crampons and supplies for an overnight in the back country. We will be hiking memorial day weekend + a few days. Some information that would be helpful for us before we go is:

1. Can you reach the summit of rainier without technical gear and what is the trail you recommend to get the highest with best views?
2. Can you describe everything we need to purchase prior to embarking and how early can we purchase it? These are things like the wilderness pass, etc. We have the gear covered so no need of recommendations there.
3. How many days does it take to hike up to the summit and back down to the base?
4. Any other helpful tips would be greatly appreciated

0,Radio dog tracker for hiking,"Edit: I am looking for recommendations on dog tracking collars! Not advice on whether my dog should be allowed off-leash. I (and my dog trainer) believe that there are other precautions and training that we can do before we deem my dog on-leash only. Also, my dog is NOT aggressive. She simple gets scared when put in an enclosed area with 20 other dogs much larger than her that all crowd her at once.

Looking for recommendations for a radio dog tracker to use while hiking. 

I take my dog off leash hiking all the time and have never had a problem until this weekend. She saw some deer (which she has seen before and didn't chase) and took off after them. Luckily I was with some other people and we knew the area so we split up and found her after about 30 minutes. I might not always be that lucky.

From what I've found, there are mainly 2 types of pet trackers: GPS and Radio. GPS is much more accurate but requires cell service which won't work for me since there typically isn't service out where I'm hiking. That leaves Radio.

I'm not worried about my dog running off without my knowing. If she runs off, I'll know. While I need the range to be good enough to find her while hiking in various terrains, I will be running right after her so she won't have that much of a head start on me (though she is obviously much faster than I am).

It looks like there are 2 main Radio trackers: Garmin and Marco Polo. The Garmin trackers are collars and have a large antenna sticking out. Not sure I need all that (not sure my dog would deal with that). I'm leaning towards the Marco Polo pet tracker but was wondering if anyone has experience with it or something else that they would recommend (or recommend against).

3,"Trying to see if I was exaggerating because of youth, or if it really was as impressive as I remember.... Zealand Trail, NH","I was 18, and headed up to Zealand Trail in NH for Spring Break (never been fond of the beach, people, or heat, so...)  The entire trip was a fiasco from beginning to end, primarily due to inexperience with New England springtime weather.  I have one particular memory that I have never been able to verify, and I'm hoping someone can help.  
I was a few miles into the trail, meandering on a few side trails (this would have been around 1989 or so) and I hear a roar in the woods.  I followed an unmaintained path up a hill toward the roar.  After maybe.. half an hour?  of more or less bushwhacking, I stumbled upon a pretty amazing sight.  There was a hole in the side of the not-quite-a-cliff mountain face about 4' or so in diameter, and out of this hole was geysering a river, full blown, a column of water gushing 8-12' in the air and crashing down into the headwaters of a river.  20' above said opening.. trees, rock, scrub, no river.  20' below the spring mouth... 8' wide river rushing down the mountain into the valley below.  These were the days before personal GPS, and my map was back in my vehicle, so I couldn't note the specific location.  The remainder of the trip was... pretty bad, and doesn't bear reliving.  Suffice it to say I could not ever find that spot again and have not met anyone who has hiked the Zealand during the spring melt.  
If anyone happens to be able to corroborate my experience, or is able to bring my memory to a more realistic version, I'd appreciate it.  
Peace.

I've never been one to return a gift but I want a Jacket that is going to work for me at this price point.  The problem is nothing on patagonia's website is sticking out to me thus I need some help.

Quick Mini Review on the Micro Puff:

Holy shit this thing is light as hell and the reviews that say ""it adjusts to the temperature you are looking for"" is spot on. Now I have not had it on in anything below 40 degrees so take that for what it's worth. The cons are only ""Potential cons"" at this point. First, I have some serious durability concerns. The jacket is so lightweight I wonder how well it can hold up. Also is the longevity, the jacket material feels like it is just so vulnerable to rips etc. 

What I am looking for:

Something I can wear every day but will hold up long term. I would rather pay for durability than for lightweight/ability to fold up as it simply isn't a feature I need. How does something like the down sweater hoody compare? Any other thoughts?

25,How to prevent a frozen water bladder?,"Hey there... I'm a pretty experienced hiker, but one thing I have always struggled to do is keep a water hydration bladder in liquid form when hiking in the cold. 

What can I do? Especially regarding the hose...

- I tried being cheap - blowing water back into the bladder. (That worked with my old bladder. Now I have an Osprey bladder and the pressure of the stuff in my backpack pushes the water up the hose making my blow back only good at filling the bladder with air.)

- I've tried insulating the hose with odds and ends clothing, etc. as well buying an insulated hose. That didn't work.

- I put a sticky foot warmer on the bladder right next to the hose. That helped when in combination with other tactics, but still didn't keep up for a whole day or night (not camping). 

- The only thing that has worked is to strap it to me inside my jacket. But a) the hose has still frozen if it's cold enough and b) sometimes I get so worked up I need to take my jacket off. ",hiking,1516723766,Jayboy1015,23,20,True,2018-01-23

### Intro
Hey guys, first post to r/hiking - unfortunately I don't get out into the bush very often.  But I do a reasonable bit of running, and r/running does really nice race reports.  I thought that I'd copy the idea to here.  Hope you like!

### Background
Mt Kosciuszko is Australia's highest point, but if we're being honest I must admit that it's comically low at an elevation of 2,228 metres.  It's a popular walk for people who are visiting a local ski resort, Thredbo.  We were here for a week over our summer, and I thought I'd take the chance to go check it out.

Being a ski resort, there is a chairlift that you can take up if you want to skip almost all of what I consider the 'good part' - the proper schlep up the hill.  That's obviously no fun, so I pulled out the resort hiking guide and off I went.

Total time from leaving my chalet to getting back was just under 4:10, total distance was 23.5 kilometres, total ascent was 1,079 metres.

### Gear
This one is great if you don't have much stuff and don't want to have to fork out for new stuff.

In terms of gear, all I had with me was water and a granola bar - not even a backpack.  I was surprised by how much I drank (3 litres, but less would have been okay), and I didn't eat at all.  A pair of old Nike's were fine, as were shorts and an old t-shirt (that's for the middle of summer - I think generally a sweater would be good).  I'm usually a huge fan of gaiters and wouldn't got walking without them, but those weren't needed wither.  I had no map other than the one linked to above (the resort map) and anything more than that isn't necessary, as the route was well marked.  Oh, and I also had my phone... just in case.  So no need for much gear at all!

In terms of crew, I did this one by myself - my kids would have struggled on the climb and my wife unfortunately wasn't interested at all - crazy!  But given that it was a family holiday and I was going off to do stuff by myself and leave all the family work to the missus I did try to keep things moving so that I could get back pretty quickly. 

### Merritt's Nature Track
There is a chairlift that you can take up to the start of the Kosciusko but, as I said above, I don't think that it sounds like much fun having to pay to ride up and miss the best part.  This is a pretty lush part of the walk and the part that I found most enjoyable - a big long uphill that criss-crosses a few creeks and weaves its way around some big trees and dense bush.

The Merritt Nature Track starts right in the Thredbo village.  It is marked as a ""strenuous"" 4 kilometres which will take 2 -
 3 hours, but I think that's probably an overstatement for most people that are reasonably fit and active - there are some pretty steep sections but it's all on a very well marked track (so no bush bashing) and where things get too steep the track has some steps built in to the path.  I can't remember how long this part took but I am pretty sure it was less than 90 mins.

There are a few places in which the path crosses other tracks (mostly mountain bike tracks and some gravel service roads) and a few places where some old wooden benches have been installed for those that want a break.  You also go under the chairlift a few times - an opportunity for everyone gliding past to think that you're crazy and for you to think the same about them! 

The other great part about this section was that it was super quiet - I only saw 6 other people on the track.

The top of this track you get to the chairlift (and a cafe, if you're desperate), and...

### Mt Kosciuszko Track
This section of the walk is a 13.5 kilometre out and back to the top of Mt Kosciusko.  It's listed as moderate and 4 - 6 hours, but honestly it's at the (very) easy end of the moderate spectrum, and even 4 hours seems to me to be a very long time for this part of the walk - that time would be considerably slower than normal walking pace.  As for 6 hours... you could probably get your nanna there and back in a wheelchair in 6 hours.

The first thing to say here is that you'll immediately notice that it is bloody windy.  Once you start this part of the walk there are almost no trees, and it's kind of a winding path along the top of the mountains with no sun protection and nothing to protect you from the elements.

Second thing is that at this point you're walking on a set path that has been laid out almost like a footpath (pavement for my American friends) - the track is mostly along metal grates, although towards the end it is made up of gravel - and in order to protect the somewhat delicate vegetation in the area there are signs asking folks not to venture off the path.  Also, while it still has a fair bit of elevation gain to it, compared to the Merritt Nature Track it's over a longer distance, so it just feels flatter.  Given this, and because it leads to the highest part of the country, the track is busy - I'd have passed hundreds of people, ranging from little kids being dragged along by their parents to grandparents being dragged along by their children.  There is also pretty good phone reception, so as soon as there is a drop in the wind people seem to get onto their phones to tell their friends where they are and send selfies or whatever.  

The main feature of this part of the walk is probably Lake Cootapatamba, an unexpected little lake (actually a tarn, as I've just learnt from wikipedia) that is quite pretty and certainly not expected.  But as per the above, you aren't meant to actually go and get close to it, and it didn't seem like there was actually much to see...  So.

At the top you can take a photo (and plenty of people stopped for a very windy lunch).  I got someone to take a snap and hustled back, doing a fair big of jogging along the way given the style of path and that it was mostly trending downhill.

### Merritt's Traverse
Back at the chairlift I started again down the Merritt Nature Track, finding it a bit less pleasant on the knees than it was going up.  After not too long I got to the intersection with the Merritt Traverse, also listed as a ""moderate"" 5 kilometre track.  Merritt's Traverse is basically a utility road that winds its way across the mountain and passes along a bunch of different chairlifts (none of which operate during the summer).

I imagine that during ski season this track would be used quite a lot by both skiers and mountain staff to get around, but at this time of year it was dead quiet and I was back to seeing almost nobody other than a few mountain staff doing some work.  There were a few ups and downs (a couple of the ups actually being reasonably steep), but overall this was a pretty relaxed way to head down the mountain.  When you're almost at the bottom you walk through the resort's frisbee golf course, and the trail pops out on the main road and right next to the resort's pool complex.

A quick walk through the village back up to our chalet and I was done!

I have very little hiking experience overall but am not in terrible shape.

Map of my general route if it helps: https://www.rome2rio.com/trip/suvsaber

Right now, my itinerary of hikes (with other stuff/resting in between) is something like:

- From Barcelona, spend a 1 whole day hiking up Mt. Pedraforca
- On way to Rome, hike Cinque Terre for 1 whole day
- In Switzerland, hike up Mt. Barrhorn, 1 whole day, then 1 whole day around Oeschinen lake. (Unless there are peaks in Italy/Austria that are similar and cheaper)
- Over to Cortina, Italy. Undetermined hiking for one day and Tre Cime for another day.
- In Slovenia, Triglav national park for two full days
- Walk the trails of Plitvice national park for one day, Croatia

Let me know if any of these seem unreasonable or poor choices compared to alternatives. If you had to cut one of these and extend another, what would it be? Should I bring 1 or 2 trekking poles and would hiking shoes and an outer layer of water-resistant clothes be enough for everything?

Do you have any personal recommendations? Are there any good hikes for May that are both scenic and not extremely crowded? I would have around 4-5 full days in total.

Or are the famous ones around Glencole and around the Isle of Skye off season in May and thus also good choices? 

Cheers and thank you for your help! :) ",hiking,1515761148,BenjiSupertramp,10,15,True,2018-01-12
1,My dog got caught in a trap in a Provincial Park,"On Saturday afternoon my girlfriend, brother, and I decided to go for a hike. We took out our book Hiking North Central BC, and found a hike that we wanted to try. Grand Canyon of the Fraser (located in the Sugar Bowl Grizzly Den Protected Area). We headed on our way to the hike. We got to the winter route Trailhead at about 12:45pm. Started snowshoeing our way into the hike, right away we noticed that there was ATV tracks, and about 100m into the trail we come across what we think is an old fire pit. We don't think twice about it, just think some teenagers had come out and partied (frustrating but not enough to stop us from enjoying the hike.). We let our dog off of her leash at this point in the hike, because we aren't too worried about her running back to the highway. She is very wary of this 'fire pit' and is acting very strange towards it, almost frightened. Still we think nothing of it and keep walking. After another 10m or so we notice there is a camera set up on a tree, we think it's weird but still not enough to stop us from enjoying the day. We continue our hike for another 100m, our dog goes ahead of us by maybe 10m. All of a sudden we hear the yelps of distress, like none of us have ever heard before. My initial thought was that our dog had gotten into a fight with a wolf or coyote. We rush over to her, and our horror only increases. She's been caught by a hunters trap. It's completely clamped around her throat, and she's struggling for her life. We panic. I'm thinking this might be the last moments that I get to spend with my dog. This isn't how I want to say goodbye to her, and it's definitely not the day I want to say goodbye to her. I get down onto my knees and struggle to see what I can do to help her. Her fight with death is a chaotic mess. My girlfriend, who works well under pressure, remains calm, examines the trap works and starts looking for a way to open it. She quickly figures out that there is two mechanisms, one on either side of the trap, that need to be gripped firmly to release the pressure on the trappers prey. We each grip one of the mechanisms, and what feels like a long time passes, and my dog fights free. My dog is shook, hurt, and blood drips from her mouth as she stand there in shock. She's hurt. She's alive. We rush back to my car to get her to a vet, and on the way out notice that what we thought was the remains of a fire, was in fact the corpse of what appears to be a moose, bones and flesh torn and litter the area around it.

Does anyone know the laws for trapping in protected areas like this within BC?

I am a runner mostly, but I do a trail 50K every year and I have really taken to hiking lately. A couple hour hiking trip would fit REALLY well in my training schedule this weekend, but I dont really have any winter hiking experience, and I am trying to wrap my head around if it even makes sense trying to get out there this weekend. 

**Trail system** 

I was thinking about getting over to the Bear Mountain / Harriman state park area.  (https://parks.ny.gov/parks/attachments/HarrimanTrailMap.pdf)
I would be starting at the inn, on some pretty busy couple trails. 

**Conditions**

As you know may know, we got quite a bit of snow last week. I believe the park got like 6-8 inches. Also, its been below freezing so even in the city the snow is still around. 

**Weekend weather considerations** 

It is supposed to be warm and rainy on both Friday and early morning on Saturday, (50 degrees finally!) before dropping into the 20s Sunday morning. I initially was thinking that these 2 days of warm rain would clean the trails a little bit, but on second thought, if it is below freezing on Sunday, the trails are probably going to be even worse. 

**thoughts** 

Does it make sense to try and get out on Saturday morning? The rain is suppose to taper off and it is only a 10% chance after 10am.  I have waterproof shoes and hiking poles - is this an awful idea? ",hiking,1515599200,runningsneaker,0,2,True,2018-01-10

50,"Totally not New Years-related, but I'm trying to push myself outside my comfort zone. What are some tips for a beginner?","This is something I've been reflecting on for the past few weeks, and not just some ""New Year's resolution"". I'd like to become the kind of person who is comfortable and confident being by themselves, instead of always being a ""third wheel"" or ""tag-along friend"". I want to be able to feel comfortable enough to start going out and doing things solely by myself, instead of relying on others to invite me, or push me outside my own comfort zone.

I feel like hiking is the kind of thing that, honestly, would be perfect for me to get into. I live in northern VA, so I imagine there are a lot of good places to go hiking, and I need to lose weight anyways. Aside from not really being an ""outdoors-y kind of person"", it seems a good place to start.

So, a few questions I have:

- What are some good hiking shoes? I have big, and *very* wide feet, and I have a hell of a time finding shoes that are comfortable. There's an REI near where I live, or I'm happy ordering something online (since most places are thankfully pretty good about refunds if they don't fit). I would personally lean towards something that's more ""minimalist"", though, as I really don't like heavy padded shoes or boots, but I'm pretty open to suggestion (especially anything that can take serious abuse).

- A regular issue I've had in the past, is just getting thirsty. I'm a big guy, and I can *drain* water when I'm physically exerting myself, especially in this cold weather. There's nothing worse than feeling like your throat is dry. Should I just carry a ton of water with me, or is that something you eventually overcome?

- I know the immediate answer is ""whatever's comfortable"", but because I've never been into hiking or anything, any tips on clothes? Like I said, I'm a big guy, so for me it's important to have clothes I don't have to worry are going to rip any time I bend over. But gym shorts, I feel like they have a nasty habit of becoming really loose after a while and wanting to slide down. Also, once weather is warmer, I'm a huge fan of sleeveless shirts, but I'd like to avoid anything that is form-fitting (since mine is not a form people are going to want to look at, at least not as-is).

And of course, any other suggestions you guys might have, I'd love to hear! Even simple stuff like ""Pros vs Cons of keeping a cell-phone handy"", or as a beginner whether or not I should be worrying about having a backpack full of water, or just stay relatively near my car?",hiking,1514900922,Jcorb,4,2,True,2018-01-02

20,Question on winter layers,"So I was out yesterday in the snow learning more about my gear. 14F at the base, reportedly 7F at the summit. I did just fine on the way up wearing a thicker-than-usual grid-like base layer, 100w fleece, and a thin softshell. Up top put on my down jacket to stay warm. Started hiking down in the puffy but then eventually took it off as I started feeling hot.

I continued hiking down in base + fleece + softshell and was just OK, maybe a little bit chilly but not cold. There was no noticeable moisture on the softshell but then the wind picked up so I wished for more wind protection and put on my hard shell, a cheapo LLBean waterproof Trail Model jacket. I continued down to the base, feeling very dry and comfortable; the trail wasn't very steep and in fact was flat in places so I wasn't exerting myself at all. When I got to the car, I was extremely surprised to find the inside of the hard shell wet with condensation and the surface of the softshell underneath starting to get wet. I guess it's not that surprising considering this hard shell isn't very breathable, but I have questions:

1. Why did I feel dry and comfortable despite all that moisture getting trapped under my layers?
2. What would have happened had I continued walking for hours? Would enough moisture get trapped to soak all my layers?
3. If not for the hard shell, how should I have layered on the descent? Thicker fleece? A vest? Is there a single magical garment that can keep me cool on the way up and warm on the way down (something like Patagonia NanoAir?)",hiking,1514478252,snacktonomy,7,3,True,2017-12-28

I'm starting to look at what I would need to bring and would like help given that I've never even seen a mountain before or go above an elevation of 2000 ft. I don't want to make plans and find out I need a lot more stuff than I thought.

First is apparel: I'd like to pack as lightly as possible, but the Barrhorn peak can sometimes go below freezing with possible snow in the summer. Would a light jacket with hood, gloves, and long pants be sufficient? I'd have extra t-shirts, socks, etc in my pack of course. What are the chances of getting stranded up there in a blizzard in July? 

For shoes, are standard hiking shoes sufficient? Or do I absolutely need boots? I'd have to carry them everywhere. For trekking poles, is it worth the extra space/weight to bring a pair as opposed to just one? (I would be doing around 5-6 other lower elevation hikes) Besides food and water, what portable supplies do I bring for safety given that I'm going alone?

Vango helium 200: similar to the banshee, but lighter and at the top end of my budget. I've never used a non-free standing tent before, but setting up this one doesn't seem too bad from what I can find online.

We’re both reasonably fit - mid-20s, played sport most of our lives and have a reasonable amount of hiking experience, albeit mainly in the UK.

We’ve got three months or so to train - is this doable?

Many thanks in advance.",hiking,1513931795,Ghibelline91,3,2,True,2017-12-22

For some reason, my lower back is the first thing on my body to sweat. Lucky me. Since I always have a pack on, instead of the sweat kinda soaking into the first couple layers and evaporating like most of the rest of my body, it soaks straight through all layers. As you can imagine, not only does my back get incredibly cold, it also starts to freeze. I can't take off the pack at all or I freeze. The everything around the area my pack is will get wet when it spreads too, not only just behind my pack. And for clarification, I'm talking about actual hikes that involve some heavy breathing and work, not just a stroll through the woods. I don't sweat excessively. 

I've given up on down for the most part.

44,"Questions about Signal Mountain, Prentice Cooper and Cumberland trails in Chattanooga","Ill be staying in Chattanooga later this week and had questions regarding a big hike I would want to do.

1. Signal mountain - if the trail markings are accurate this will be around 35-40 miles from Signal Point park -&gt; Up the Signal Point trail/Cumberland trail -&gt; pass both the Julia Falls overlook and then the Edwards Point -&gt; cross both north and south suck creek -&gt; cross highway 27 and continue onto the cumberland trail -&gt; Take the Cumberland trail onto Mullens cove loop until I hit Snoopers rock, where I am hoping to get picked up by an Uber since there is a parking lot there.

With that description being said I have a couple questions:

1. Overall, how good/solid does this route look?

2. Safety - Safety is a big priority of mine. I know most of this route is on the edge of PCSP and Signal Mountain, how is the exposure? High drop offs? Am I in any real danger? Any sketchy parts. (I was researching Signal Point trail and I saw some news stories of people dying from falling)

3. How clean and maintained and MARKED are the trails. I kept reading that some of the trail isn't maintained well and hardly marked making connecting trail heads and the trail in general hard to follow. (Mostly Mullens Cove, and Signal Point Trail) - I would also like to know the trail conditions of the portions of the Cumberland Trail I listed cause I could not find anything online.

4. SUPER IMPORTANT: A big part of this plan is me taking an Uber at my termination point at the Snoopers Rock parking lot area. IS THERE PHONE RECEPTION AT THE SNOOPERS ROCK AREA? I would hate to hike 40 or so miles only to find out there is no signal/reception to even use my phone to uber and have to hike back another 40. It is super important that I need to know if I will be able to call an Uber at this end point

I am in Québec, and our winters are pretty much all over the place : sometimes it rains and it's a slushy mess, sometimes it's -30 C or worse (though that doesn't happen very often and I wouldn't want to go out at that temperature anyway). -20 C days are common.

I was thinking about what to wear. I know about the layering principle : I'll buy a merino wool or synthetic long-sleeve shirt.

What about the mid/outer layer ? I often read that I need something breathable, but generally a coat that is breathable is also not that warm, no ? I know that I will feel pretty hot after a while of moving around, so a breathable garment would be good, but I fear getting cold when we stop for x or y reason.

I need a new winter coat for everyday use anyway, so I was thinking of buying a Rab Neutrino Endurance since it seems very warm and it could be useful to carry if I ever feel cold.

For the first time, I probably will go in my normal winter clothes, but it would be useful to gear up for future trips.

To summarize, I'm quite lost. What should I get ? Fleece, down jacket, synthetic ?",hiking,1512760965,Vaginite,10,6,True,2017-12-08

I’m aware the Rockies do have higher elevation but the Cascades to me have a more rugged feel. There are more glacial peaks where ice traverse skills are essential and there is definitely more risk involved. For example, most Colorado 14ers are easily “hikeable” while Mt Rainier in the Cascades isn’t as high yet a summit of that mountain requires a much much more explicit set of skills and harder difficulty. I’m wondering if there was anything in Colorado that compares to glacial peaks or has the PNW become standard for the mountaineering type?

5,Hybrid lightweight hiking shoes/trail runners with low drop?,"So, I'm going to be in the mountains probably for a few months and I want to take this opportunity to do short hikes with my dog two or three times a week. It will be something very easy and casual in moderately cold weather, maybe three or four hours max, and never in wet/snowy conditions (because I won't bother then).

The only issue is that these hikes will involve a combination of road and trail, so I need something that can withstand both. I know some of you are going to tell me to carry two pairs, but I really, really don't want to do that. Other than that, I hate heavy shoes, I like very low drops (I've hiked a lot with NB Minimus, for example), prefer bigger toeboxes and absolutely hate loaded designs (e.g. La Sportiva, it doesn't matter how good they are, there's no way I'm wearing that).

I was thinking about buying something like the Adidas Terrex Agravic, but I'm worried about destroying that sole by using it on the road. Does anybody know about any hybrid shoes or maybe road shoes with less of a flat sole that I could use?

3. I've done a certificate in Outdoor Recreation, with assessments on hiking &amp; orienteering, so I am knowledgeable with all the basics. Are the tracks marked well, or should I do some solid research and print off the different maps for navigation?

14,Problem with boots! Advice needed,"tl;dr Meindl boots made my feet numb after 5 mins of wear, store exchanged for Mammut’s Trovat. 

Hey guys!

I did my research of what boots to get for a couple of months before I actually bought a pair, I went for the Meindl women’s Bhutans, the reviews are great the company is respectable and they gave me this amazing fit when I tried them on.

I have wide feet and am known to be a boot destroyer, I just can’t make a pair last! So this time I really took my time to research before investing in a really good pair.

I started wearing my boots couple of weeks ago around the house and to uni, double socked (thick socks) to get a good break, odd thing is, it made my feet numb, yes numb!
I did a quick google it suggested maybe try different lacing, tried that, and within 5 minutes my feet were going numb again, and the numbness was traveling up to my calf. I’ve gone through a few pairs of boots in the past and none of them have given me that sensation, even after a 10-12 hour hike.

I tried the boots with just one sock and went about my day it got numb pretty quick but I persevered, plenty of toe wiggling and loosening up the laces, on the bus back from Uni, it was actually total agony, it went from super numb to just painful.

Which brings us to today, I went back to the store and said what was happening and they were just as confused as me, Ultimate Outdoors are awesome guys on the customer service front, I tried my boots with different insoles and walked a bit in their ‘indoor outdoor’ boot testing area and it was still happening, i tried a new pair of the same boots and it was the same issue- on both feet, the numbness felt it started on my intrinsic muscles and near the sural nerve.

The assistant gave me a pair of Mammut women’s Trovat advance Gore-tex to try and see if they were any better- it was much roomier and I had them on for a while so no numbing issues. 

The store was really nice and exchanged the boots for me, I felt a bit saddened because my heart was set on the Meindls but it is comfort above anything when it comes to walking boots.

So, has anyone experienced numbness with your boots? Did you ever find out why? 

Thanks!

In mine (I live in Arizona):

MULE camelbak (highly recommend)

3L of water

Lunch and high carb snacks

First aid kit : tweezers, bandaids, super glue, gauze, canvas fabric, waterproof medical tape, pain meds and benadryl (I carry it mostly in case of snake bites on my dog).

Larger pocket knife

Extra socks and layer

Sunscreen

Toilet paper

ID/money/insurance card

EVO hammock

Dogs pack: (ruffwear Approach pack - solid purchase although I'd get the palisade if I had to do it over)

Dog food/poop bags

2L of water in neoprene bottles

Leash

Large carabiner (a must, so useful)

Collapsible water bowl

I've been super grateful for the tweezers with several cactus incidences on both my dog and I. My MULE camelbak I just got this year and holy hell was it a wonderful investment.  I love that I have 3L of water instead of 2 and my back never hurts. It's lightweight but tons of storage. I love my hammock the most because it's awesome to find a cool spot and just relax. The super glue has come in handy when I got a bad cut and needed to buy time to get back down the mountain and get stitches. Socks are mandatory in my backpack now after I forgot long socks and wore ankle socks with midrise boots on a 14 mile trek over a mountain pass. That was miserable. Lesson learned from a stupid mistake. The chafing  was significant. I love the large carabiner I have for my dog. It's easy to the him on a tree or on a patio afterwards or hook him to my pack.

8,Communicating an emergency by cell phone from the backcountry,"I have been trading email with some people that are pondering ‘best practices’ for using a cell phone to communicate during an emergency.  From those discussions, combined with some googling I have been doing, my current thinking is to suggest communication be attempted according to the following prioritized list.

These thoughts are focused on trying to establish communications.  It is also important to take steps to prolong battery life but that is not the topic of these notes.

**Tip:** If there is more than 1 phone available try each step with each phone.  Different phones may have different carriers, different signal strengths, different roaming agreements, etc.

**Tip:**  Even if your phone shows no bars, consider trying each step.  I read an interview with an expert who pointed out that some phones might update the bar display only every 15 minutes or so.

**1.  Always start by trying to make a voice call to 911.**

Do this whether or not you see any bars on your phone!

It is important to wait 45-60 seconds for a 911 call to go through before giving up.  For the reason behind this timing recommendation please see p.5 “Tip #1 Details” of this pdf:
[https://mappingsupport.com/p/sar/call-911-with-a-cell-phone.pdf](https://mappingsupport.com/p/sar/call-911-with-a-cell-phone.pdf)

All wireless carriers are required by FCC regulations to carry all 911 voice calls as long as the tower and phone have compatible technology.  If your phone can only ‘see’ a single tower with which your carrier does *not* have a roaming agreement then (1) your phone will not show any bars but (2) you will still be able to make a voice call to 911 assuming sufficient signal strength.

**2.  Try texting to 911.**

Note!  Text to 911 **does not** use roaming!  For this to even have a chance of working your phone must have a good enough connection with a cell tower owned by your carrier for the text to go through.

Your carrier will attempt to route your text to the 911 call center with jurisdiction for your location.  However, that call center might not yet have the ability to receive texts to 911.  If this does not work then you should receive some kind of response indicating the text message failed.

**3.  Try texting to someone that can relay your message to the authorities.**

Critical: Be certain to turn on voice roaming before trying this step.  Normal texting **does** use voice roaming.  (You do not need to turn on data roaming.)  If your phone has a weak connection with a ‘roaming’ cell tower then you might be able to communicate by text but not voice. 
- - - - -

It is also possible to display the signal strength in decibels between your phone and a cell tower.

**Android**
On my Samsung S6 this is found by doing Settings ==&gt; Mobile networks.  The value for Signal strength is the one to look at.  The decibel level is a negative number and values closer to zero represent a stronger signal.  My S6 does not have any calling plan and shows a decibel value of -120.  A decibel value of -80 seems to generally be considered a strong signal.

If an Android phone is roaming and can only see a single ‘roaming’ cell tower then does the “Signal strength” field show the signal strength for that roaming cell tower?  I am still looking for the answer.

**iPhone**
If you have an iPhone you can display the **“Field test mode”** screens.  Using the phone keypad enter *3001#12345#* and then tap the call button.  You should see a black and white screen with choices for drilling down further.  I have an older iPhone 4S that does have a calling plan.  One of the Field test screens displays a “Base ID” value.  This is an identifier related to the cell tower that my phone ‘sees’.  If my phone did not see any cell tower then I expect this field would be blank.  The data field “Rx AGC0"" shows the signal strength between my phone and the tower as “-87 dBm”.   I have no problem making calls with this signal strength.

But if your iPhone shows a signal strength of around -100 dBm then you might have trouble communicating.  But at least you would know that there is a tower your phone can see.  Although the general advice is to stay put when lost, this might be sufficient reason to move to higher ground in order to try and get a stronger signal.

If an iPhone is roaming and can only see a single ‘roaming’ cell tower then do the “Field test screens” show the signal strength for that roaming cell tower?  So far I have not found the answer.  

I would enjoy hearing input from others that have thought about this stuff.

My feet sweat and it makes me feel hotter so I’m hoping to grab some lightweight breathable shoes that will protect my ankles from plants scratching them. Should I grab pants or wear shorts or capris? Trying to take advantage of the sales going on right now and in the coming weeks. So far, I don’t have any pair of shoes equip for hiking. I have running shorts I could wear (jeans were too constricting) and I’m thinking of grabbing some shirts that’ll wick sweat. Other pairs of shoes I’ve been thinking about are:
Salomon Speedcross 4 
Keen Targhee 2

I’m looking for shoes that are comfortable and have good arch, ball of foot, and heel support, have good traction (for big rocks and otherwise), are lightweight, and look nice. I’m not sure that many of the trails around here have water sources I’d be going through so I’m not sure if waterproofing would be necessary.

37,Winter clothing for trip to Northern Norway,"Hi all,

I am going to go to Norway (Tromso) in Mid December and realised my winter gear is not the greatest.

I expect temperatures of 0 to -5°C around Tromso. I expect there will be quite a lot of snow and perhaps rain on warmer days. I plan to go more inland so I expect the temperatures to be much lower too.

I plan to get a car and drive around, explore the area and city on foot, take northern lights pictures and do activities like dog sledding and snow mobile driving. So most of the time I will not do any demanding activities and the tour organisers will lend me clothing but if I get my hands on good gear I'd just use my own (I need it anyway), but I would like to reuse the gear I buy in the future for more demanding winter activites.

I thought about getting something like the [Patagonia Jackson Glacier Down Jacket](http://eu.patagonia.com/ie/en/product/mens-jackson-glacier-down-jacket/27920.html?dwvar_27920_color=NVYB&amp;cgid=mens-jackets-vests-insulated#tile-5=&amp;start=1&amp;sz=24) or similar. Or should I just go with a normal down jacket and a hard shell on top?
I have a [Jack Wolfskin Iceland](https://www.jack-wolfskin.com/iceland-3in1-men/1105743-6000002.html) jacket (hard shell + 200 fleece, should I just go with this one?

I will also get long synthetic/cotton underwear, what brand would you recommend that is not too expensive? I have a hat but I will have to get proper gloves too.

I suppose normal (hiking/outdoor) trousers with longjohns should be okay? Or should I get something warmer?

I have somewhat thick and medium hiking socks and normal leather hiking boots, should I get different shoes or should those be okay?

31,Questions about Santa Cruz trek (Peru),"Hi all,

I am doing the Santa Cruz trek on May next year and I am deciding were to start, if in Cashapampa or Vaqueria.

I am doing this trek with my GF without any guides, so we will be carrying all of our gear.
She does not do much hiking and with the altitude is going to be a hard trek for her. So I am deciding were to start to make it as easy as possible.

Starting in Cashapampa:
This is my option right now. The CON is that you start at a lower altitude than Vaqueria, so you got more climing.
The PRO is that you do the high pass in the third day and you start that day from 4200m instead of 3800m.
Another PRO is that you have more days to get used to the altitude.

Any way, just wanted to see if any of you guys did the trek and what do you recommend.

So my question is: I’m aware of the dangers of solo hiking, but what’s the big deal about it? There are more inherent dangers being alone in the woods or in the mountains yes but it seems there is a threshold for some, like your first solo hike is a milestone or something, so again am i missing something? What’s the big deal?

Also pretty experienced, hiked around 200-250 miles total in the front range in the last 11 months and i took 3-4 months off, so i did a lot of solo hiking at a high frequency.
