13,Scarpa Instinct VS - Sizing Question,"I'm currently on the hunt for some shoes to fit my wide feet. I have been climbing in a pair of La Sportiva Finales but they have been causing a fair amount of foot pain. I ordered a pair of Scarpa Instinct VS and they feel excellent. Wide in the front with a nice toe curl. However, I have a tiny bit of space in the heel. I'm wearing a size 46 and the next size down is a 45. They won't stretch much, so not sure sizing down a full size will be best.

18,First shoes - Momentum/Tarantula?,"Just getting into climbing. Really hyped but stumped on what shows to invest in.
I imagine much of my time now will be spent in the gym, but my long term goals are to get into outdoor bouldering and eventually trad.
I don't want to drop 100+ on shoes out the gate, and have seen some good reviews of BD's momentum and the Tarantula (Velcro).
Am I thinking along the right lines here? 
I've ordered both to try on but only the momentums can be climbed in with full refund. I ordered two sizes for each pair, 9's and 9.5 (and the equivalent for the tarantulas).
As I understand the synthetic momentums will not stretch much whereas the others will (half to full size up).  But because I have wide feet, and wear wide hiking shoes, I figured I'd try them out around about what I normally wear in those.
The momentums arrived and seem doable.  There's some toe curling on the 9.5's but I hear thats not bad.  I notice my big toe doesn't quite reach the end of the toe box while standing flat.  The 9's are definitely very uncomfortable to force on, but I've also hears the BD's should stretch about a half size.
If you are still reading this - thank you, as I am at a total loss here.  If there is a better sub-100$ shoe that will work for a beginner who doesn't want to be held back by shoe selection within a couple of months - lemme know.
If the tarantulas are a better choice overall I'll take the risk and climb in them (can still exchange, just no refunds). ",climbing,1536218508,feathersfolly,18,1,True,2018-09-06

https://imgur.com/a/4ByOYwH

Do you guys think it is time for a resole yet? The right shoe doesn't have that dip as pronounced yet, but I guess it would be best to also resole them. 

I'm mainly wondering (new to the resole business): 

1) Can/should I wait a bit more before I get it resoled? 
2) Is the rand already affected? Can I just get a repair of the sole and expect the shoes to hold up for another 4 months this way? 

In general, I'm wondering about the economic sense of the whole resoling. In my case, the previous Otakis I had held up for 10 months before they both developed holes. That means the only difference between getting it resoled twice (4 months in and 8 months in later on) in price would be around 70 euros. That might be a price I am willing to pay or a fresh new shoe, that doesn't stink.

How do you guys handle this. Resole to the max or wearing down and getting a fresh model?

32,Stretch marks after a few months of climbing: Is this normal ?,"Hello everyone, I started climbing (gym bouldering mainly) about 4 month ago and today I just noticed that I have small stretch marks right where my shoulders and pectorals meets. 

I only climb 3 times a week (1h-1h30 minutes max), sometimes a 4th, longer time on the week-ends. I don't feel like my arms/shoulders got that much larger in those 4 months so I'm starting to wonder if it's normal to have those stretch marks after so little time climbing. 

I read that I probably need to drink more water so I do now but is it really the cause ? Have anyone here got the same problem ? Is there anything I can do besides drinking more water to solve this problem (I really don't want to climb less) ?

33,Diagnose My Finger Pain Please,"Hi! A bit of background on myself, i've been climbing for almost three years now.  I'm a pretty healthy 22 year old.  5'7"" 150 lbs.  Sometime around near the end of my first year of climbing I started getting pain in my fingers.  I would also get wrist pain which kept me from climbing, but the wrist pain is completely fine now, i think that was just tightness in my forearms causing inflammation in my wrists.  

&amp;#x200B;

So my fingers have been hurting for years now.  Crimping down hard is what causes the pain and its a pain in the joints rather than my tendons.  The pain is only in the second and third knuckles of my ring and middle finger of both my hands.  I personally think it's synovitis, but I've taken time off several times, ranging from two weeks to two months.  The pain always comes back right away.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, fastforward to now, I havent been climbing as much over the summer because of work, but I'm back to school and looking to climb again.  I've been doing pullups with my fingers only on a pullup bar (which im starting to think isnt the best of ideas) and I noticed that when I come down after doing a slow pullup (30 seconds on the bar) my fingers are incredibly stiff.  I can close my hand right away, but I can't open my fingers for a couple of seconds.

49,Advice For Beginners,"Morning everyone, sorry if this is posted in a FAQ, I just didn’t see it.

Outside of taking long hikes, what advice would you give for two 30 year olds who have a goal to climb Denali by the time they are 40? 

We have no climbing training so I know we will be flying out to take climbing courses on Rainier or somewhere similar to help us get the terminology and basics down.

My buddy has a strong military background and we are both avid long distance bikers (at least doing the 330+ mile GAP/ C&amp;O trail by our homes in Pennsylvania). We normally do 30-40 miles with minimal stops in our training sessions. 

But here’s my personal caveat; I’m definitely well overweight. My goal is to drop 100 pounds within a year. I’m also a heavy smoker (this weekend is my first foray into quitting). This hasn’t really affected my biking but obviously I know mountaineering is a much more difficult and amazing beast.

Thanks for any advice and keep up the great posts in here, they are absolutely encouraging.

50,Starting to train. Looking for feedback.,"I've been climbing for close to 10 years. I've never been super serious about it- I got into it because my dad was into it. I did some trad climbing with him in NC before I went to college, but it's been mostly bouldering since. I boulder at the V4/V5 level and I think I've plateaued- With as often as I climb, I think I've maxed how good I can get without dedicating time to actually train. Looking to get some feedback and maybe some tips/tricks!

I can climb/train 3-4 times a week in the gym. My schedule is goofy, so I'll just number the workouts as Day 1-4, with rest days whenever they happen.

**Day One - Hangboard**

Warm up on some easy routes- Climb several V0s/V1s

Stretch. Pull each finger back for 10 seconds, roll the shoulders out, deadhang for 10 seconds with relaxed shoulders. 

Hang time. 5 reps of 10 seconds on/5 seconds off. Rest for 5 min, repeat 3x.

Wrist curls.  5lb barbell and do 20 reps per arm. This is for injury prevention more than anything.

Hang until failure at 15mm, 20mm, and 35mm holds in that order. 

Climb the V1s/V0s to cool down.

Total Time: 30/45 minutes. An hour if I dick around more on the wall.

**Day Two - Climb/Weights**

Same Warmup, Same stretch.

Pyramid: 5 V1s, 4 V2s, 3 V3s, 2 V4s, 1 V5, 2 V4s, 3 V3s, 4 V2s, 5 V1s. 

Attempt the V6 problem I've been working on just because.

Weight Train: Squats, Deadlifts, Bench Press, Shoulder Press, Bent-Over Row. All done with just the bar or maybe a set of 25s- going for low weight, high rep to build endurance and balance the pulling muscles with some pushing muscles. 

End with the same cool down.

Total Time: 1 hr - 1.5 hrs

**Day Three - Campusing**

Same Warmup, Same stretch

I'm currently terrible at this. I hang on the fattest rung and try to work my way up and down one rung at a time. Eventually I'll start trying to do more rungs at a time. I go up with my right hand first until failure and then again with my left hand. Rest for 3 min. Repeat 5x. 

5 sets of 10 pullups

Hang on pullup bar with 1 arm until failure, then switch. Currently using a band for assistance. 

Same cooldown unless I have time to throw in some core work. Usually do an ab workout from youtube. 

Total Time: 30 min

**Day Four - Project Day**

Same Warmup, Same stretch

Pyramid similar to Day 2

Go back to the V6 I'm working on and give it several attempts. If I send it, I'll find a new one!

Find the hardest route I can successfully climb and hit it over and over until failure.

Same cooldown.

Time: 1 hour

58,New harness: normal belay loop wear?,"Hi all! I recently purchased my first harness and I’ve gone top roping about three times with it.

I recently noticed that the edge of my harness has turned a dark brown. It looks singed but I’ve never exposed to heat or fire. I only use to the belay loop to belay. I’m wondering if it’s just dirt or friction from the rope that caused it? 

I can also see threads at the end poking through, although I don’t think these are load bearing. 

Is this normal wear and tear or should I be concerned?

Loose means 1mm (see pic, normally the plastic is in contact with the metal), but I don't remember this being the case when new and I also wonder what happens when the device is loaded with a climber's weight.

I googled a bit and it turns out that some MegaJul did break in the past (see e.g. [https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/114338282/megajul-unexpectedly-broke-during-while-rapping-yesterday](https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/114338282/megajul-unexpectedly-broke-during-while-rapping-yesterday)) exactly because of the cable coming off the plate.

Should I retire the device (or am I being paranoid)?

Should I write to the manifacturer?

19,I have changed my view of progression to working V2-V5 downclimb beta instead of progressing V6+ at my gym. Anyone else do this?,"I am just curious if anyone else settled into this method of challenging themselves and would love to get a discussion going. As far as my rationale goes it can be summed up pretty quickly...

**I have never liked crimps.** 

Anytime I had to take a break from climbing to heal it was because of crimps and because of pushing progression. I always felt like a majority of the challenge in the V6+ realm comes from shrinking the holds and forcing crimps, which leads to finger pain, which can lead to a forced rest. 

I will work them sometimes, but I am not too attached to progressing in that realm.

&amp;nbsp;

**Two things have always stuck out from my research on finger strength and injuries:** 

* Muscles build fast (just think how quick you progressed once you started developing that forearm strength) 
* It takes years to build pulley/tendon strength (aka you get to V6 before your pulleys/tendons are ready)

What ends up happening is people get hooked and build that muscle fast which gets them to the high grades quickly. Then shit gets crimpy and they start to hurt or tear their pulleys/tendons ([usually the A2 pulley - some great visuals in this article](http://cruxcrush.com/2013/10/24/climber-problems-the-a2-pulley-strain/)). They either wise up and take a rest or push it to hard and blow a pulley. 

Either way they are out of commission. Apparently training on a hangboard can help, but the takeaway for me was always that the risk of finger injury just plain skyrockets when you get to crimpland. 

I never really wanted to develop a training/hangboard regimen just so I could do more routes with holds that I didn't like so...I didn't. Climbing was just my fun, consistent workout and avoiding crimps and consistent progression became part of that.

&amp;nbsp;

Eventually I started downclimbing routes so I could keep getting a good pump and breaking a sweat in my fun workouts. I pretty quickly realized

&gt; **""holy shit, this is two betas per route on all of the holds are ones actually LIKE""**

and have been doing it for some time now. Nobody else at my gym ever talks about downclimb beta though so in my curiosity I came to good old reddit.

Soooo yea, anyone else stop trying to go higher and higher on grades but **still challenge themselves by treating a downclimb like an actual route?** 

Downclimbing is obviously also a safe, knee and ankle preserving way to get off the wall which is nice, but I am really curious if anyone thinks about coming down as a route and challenge unto itself.


Cheers if you made it through this overly long post (I didn't plan on writing this much but it happened). Happy Friday!

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:**

I hate crimps. Crimps lead to hurt fingers. Hurt fingers mean I have to rest. Having to rest means I cant climb. 

I started avoiding crimps by staying below V6 and thinking of downclimbs as entirely separate routes, striving to be able to go up and down any route I like.

This is a long winded way of finding out if anyone else thinks this way because I haven't bumped into anyone at my gym that does.

16,Shoulder Dislocation Bouldering," 

Hi guys,

In 2015  I dislocated my shoulder whilst falling awkwardly out of a handstand, the shoulder fell back in without too much effort although later that day I re-dislocated it which took a larger amount of effort to relocate. After the accident I was advised by an orthopaedic surgeon to work on strengthening the ligaments and muscles around the shoulder, and surgery might be avoidable. Over the past three years at times it has left unstable, but I have slowly worked on physical therapy till now where it has been feeling almost pain free and feeling stable . Since starting bouldering I’ve worked even more on strengthening my shoulders, understanding the stress they are under due to the sport. This in mind, while on a wall last Sunday I’ve had my left arm extended at 60 degrees and crimped down hard next thing I know I’m lying on the mat with my shoulder dislocated. I was able to manipulate my body against the mat as I could feel it would go back in. My question; is there any possibility of recovering from this without a shoulder stabilisation surgery and continue climbing? Does anyone have experience or understanding of this procedure are there any risks involved such as loss of mobility or re-occurring problems?  Would surgery with physio along with stretch therapy result in the best outcome? Or should it be avoided?

I’ve had my MRI I’m waiting for the report and will be seeing an orthopaedic surgeon in the next couple days. Would really appreciate opinion on if a conservative treatment could work. 

Thanks for your time, 

Sorry i'm not sure where the most appropriate place would be to make this post.

However, I believe fingers are completely different and I never know when a bit of pain is fine for climbing or if it could lead to a serious injury.

I started bouldering two years ago and I never had any particular pain, although recently (about 3 months ago), I started pushing myself with some more difficult problems like 6b+/6c. Since then, I started experiencing some pain in the ""flashy part"" of my fingers. It usually disappear completely after warming up, but it sometimes remain until the end of the training. When I'm not training, it also happens that a very specific movement of a finger, or a very localised area, feels particularly painful, like pinching my thumb and finger while holding my hand behind my back!

16,Advice about finger injury,So I was at the gym a couple of days ago and I fear I may have messed up my hand. I was on a pocket heavy boulder problem using  only my middle and ring fingers. It ended with a solid sloper followed by a crimp and finally a jug top out. When I grabbed the crimp my only foot cut and I felt a pop in my hand  holding said crimp. Whenever I use my grip ball now it hurts in the center of my hand and near my middle finger. I’ve looked it up and all I can find is an A2 pulley tear.

I didn't want to say anything immediately but something about it seemed iffy. Could anyone with more experience explain whether it is a perfectly safe anchor which 10/10 would whip or is there something amiss here?

22,Rock Over Climbing reopening on September 1st after fire,"If you climb in or around Manchester, you've probably heard that Rock Over Climbing has been closed recently due to a fire.

We didn't actually catch fire, but the building next door to us was so badly damaged by the fire that it's had to be completely demolished.

It's going to take us in total about a week and a half to clear up after the smoke damage. This is also going to include a reset of the entire centre as each hold has to soaked in Benky and then jetwashed to get them completely clean.

Some of the GB Climbing Team have very kindly offered to come in and help us reset this week, but it's still going to be a big job setting over 200 problems in 5 days!

The photo is what used to be our hold store, and you can see the demolished building through the hole. This is actually a result of part of the other buildings roof crashing down on us during the fire.

Maybe it requires less force to hold it down, but safety wise you'd still drop almost like a stone if your partner makes a mistake, right?

We learned to climb, rappel, tie knots, make our own webbing harnesses, one-handed bowlines, and how to belay. I worked for a local outfitter for years, but it was a commercial operation , and I did not meet many people willing to share climbing with me. It was some special club I couldn’t join.


I haven’t done any of this in many years. I’m 42 now, I’ve had my kids and they’re old enough to climb and mountain bike.

In general I’ve felt like the outdoors community, despite its Welcome Everyone! Vibe, is anything but. I wasn’t born to climbing so I’m not welcome. 

And now, I’m too old, or so I’m told. I can Gym climb for fun, but I’ll never get on a real rock. Yes, a gym climber told me this. I should just view this as a workout.

I’ve also read numerous books on training and done training programs myself. However, recently I taught a private lesson for a person that I just described in the title, and it’s a little difficult for me because he is not able to do the same exercises that kids or young adults are typically able to do at a beginner level. So far I’ve had him do pull-ups using an assisted pull-up machine(taking off a lot of weight), and done some relatively easy core-work like knee raises because he can’t do sit ups or Russian twists or anything like that.  He knows a good deal of technique but most of the time he doesn’t have the confidence in himself to try things that I suggest while he’s climbing on the wall, so I think that if his strength is increased he will have more confidence in himself while climbing. The only problem is that the supplemental exercises that I’m used to are too difficult for him.

24,The Asian Games are underway. Quals are over.,"I rarely watch plastic climbing comps but I'm stuck indoors, it's hot AF outside, and this was on TV anyway. I caught a bit of the bouldering quals and a good chunk of the lead quals. Speed quals were already over. Because I don't watch plastic comps I'm not aware of any other comp that has adopted the Olympic-style combined format yet. At least for me, this is a good pre-run to see how that format will play itself out on a larger scale. What's weird here is that there is a medal for speed, medal for combined (lead+boulder+speed), and a medal for speed relay (not sure how this even works) but that's just the Asian Games. The Olympics will only have the combined medal.


Here are the [men's results](https://en.asiangames2018.id/sport/sport-climbing/event/sport-climbing-men-combined/) and [women's results](https://en.asiangames2018.id/sport/sport-climbing/event/sport-climbing-women-combined/) after quals. The scores are calculated by your rank in each discipline multiplied, with the lowest score winning. We'll have to consider that the level of competition here has huge disparity. That being said, there's a big gap between the podium and those outside. Top 6 made finals. Not surprising to see that the two Japanese and two Korean climbers get four spots, then someone else fairly well-rounded (Au &amp; Lee), and someone who blitzed up the speed wall (Khaibullin &amp; Marlenova, coincidentally both from Kazakhstan). It seems like the way the points are calculated, unless you really shit the bed in lead and boulder, winning speed will get you in the finals. I wasn't sure how I felt about it initially but after seeing the table, I'm okay with a ""discipline winner"" basically getting a spot in the finals. 


Finals are tomorrow and they're starting with speed. No indication on which of lead or boulder will be next but if they follow the quals order then it'll be boulder first. I'd be interested to see how the single day finals will turn out logistically for the climbers.

29,Advice for building mind-body connection?,"I've been a desk jockey my whole life. Due to life circumstance, I was never exposed to sports or really physical activity much at all and used video games as escape, and eventually my career. Luckily I never got significantly overweight, but I was never active or in shape and my hand-eye coordination is good only in as much as a mouse and keyboard is involved. If you asked me or my family you would have just said I was ""never into all that active stuff"".

&amp;#x200B;

In 2018, my life goal has been to change all that, because I didn't think it was true - just circumstantial. Earlier this year I trained for a 10K and started heavy weight lifting - hating the former but expanding the latter to 5 days a week. I've gone out hiking, kayaking, and I bike almost every day. In May, I started rock climbing, and fell in love. As of today I'm in the best shape of my life, I feel strong and capable in ways I didn't know possible (but with many years of gains to be had). I've been extensively reading articles and books on climbing as well as the two reddit climbing forums.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously I'm still very very new and there are tons of ""noob gains"" to be had by ""just climbing"" (which I do as often as my body allows, which appears to be more and more). But I can tell I'm being hugely held back by two things: lack of trust in my body to perform and lack of mind-body connection, and I would like some advice on how to improve these things, especially from people who have overcome them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very cerebral and in my thoughts a lot. Awareness of where my body is in space and what it's doing is usually very low, and I am currently putting most of my training effort into watching/focusing on my body parts (feet, core) to make sure they're doing what I want them to do. In my normal life I'm very clumsy and bump into things, trip, and knock things over all the time. I suck at throwing/catching things and am just generally ungraceful.

&amp;#x200B;

More importantly, I just don't trust my body. I am often observing these minute hesitations in my daily life for things that I assume I can't do, and I have to remind myself to at least give it a try (ex: lifting my weight to climb on top of something, picking up a heavy thing, leveraging something that is stuck). In climbing, I frequently notice that I won't instinctively try to stand up on a hold because I don't think my legs can do it. I SUCK at reaching holds that require a big push into a grab because the confidence isn't there, and I do a wimpy attempt and peel off after hanging around below the hold for several seconds agonizing about how I won't be able to do it. Logically, I know I \*could\* do it. But I'm always pre-convincing myself that I can't. I'm reading The Rock Warrior's Way now and I feel like I'm doing basically the opposite of everything he recommends. I set myself up for failure by looking at things without objective framing and without confidence. I see everything as being too hard, too scary, above my level.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I unlearn a lifetime (30 years) of believing I'm weak and incapable? Do you have any advice for how you developed confidence or equanimity in a rock climbing setting, especially from former lazy uncoordinated gumbies?",climbing,1535209755,kelpants,16,1,True,2018-08-25

40,Asian Games Women's Final recap,"They started the day with speed. This was my first time watching a full speed comp start to finish so I wasn't sure wth was going on, other than that the person who tags the thing at the top first wins. I thought they were going to just rank athletes by time, but they did a full set of head-to-head races to determine the 1-6 rank. The rankings after the speed round was:

Climber | Speed | Boulder | Lead | Points
-|-|-|-|-
Sa | 1 | - | - | 1
Marlanova | 2 | - | - | 2
Lee | 3 | - | - | 3
Ito | 4 | - | - | 4
Kim | 5 | - | - | 5
Noguchi | 6 | - | - | 6


The bouldering round really separated out the competitors. On F1, Lee and Marlenova couldn't even reach the zone(bonus) hold. Kim had trouble with F2 because of her height. F3 was a big disappointment on the setters because the beta was broken. Everyone who topped F3 used the zone hold only as a foot; they didn't even bother to tag it with a hand just for the bonus point and instead just took it to the top. Marlenova was the only one to not top this, and she touched the zone hold with her hands when she tried to dyno to it out of desperation. F4 was similar. The setters probably wanted the climbers to sideways-dyno into a double-gaston. No one did that, and instead just went straight up. This put the climbers in a weird spot where they had to basically downclimb a move to tag the zone hold, and a couple of them almost fell doing so.


Climber | F1 | F2| F3 | F4 | Total
-|-|-|-|-|-
Noguchi | T | T | T | T | 4T4z
Ito | T | T | T | z | 3T4z
Kim | T | z | T | z | 2T4z
Sa | z | T | T | z | 2T4z
Lee | - | z | T | z | 1T3z
Marlenova | - | z | - | - | 0T1z


Rankings after Speed+Boulder:


Climber | Speed | Boulder | Lead | Points
-|-|-|-|-
Sa | 1 | 4 | - | 4
Noguchi | 6 | 1 | - | 6
Ito | 4 | 2 | - | 8
Marlanova | 2 | 6 | - | 12
Kim | 5 | 3 | - | 15
Lee | 3 | 5 | - | 15


I don't know how tiebreakers work but whatever rule they use, Kim beats Lee, so Lee went first. This was 4th day on climbing for these athletes after 3 straight days of quals. They all looked tired. Lee fought the pump as much as she could before falling around halfway up. Marlenova was clearly already out of gas towards the end of the bouldering round, and ended up only making a handful of moves up the wall. Kim took it to the top like a champ. She didn't look that tired either. The final move to the top hold was a dyno and she caught it with room to spare. She probably knew this guaranteed her a medal as she got a bit emotional celebrating at the top. Ito made good progress until her knee popped and she fell. I got a little uneasy watching them climb this route because there were lots of tweaky-looking heel hooks - those that you bring your foot up to your waist height and your leg goes sideways horizontal. Ito was in the middle of a leftward cross move with her right leg in this position and ended up getting injured. She was clutching her right knee as she got lowered and remained on the ground even after getting lowered. She had to get carried out on a board. Noguchi looked like she had a pretty good chance of taking it to the top as well but looks like the fatigue finally caught up to her. At this point, Sa was guaranteed a silver and needed to best Noguchi's position for the gold. She looked like she was well on her way until she fell just about where Ito fell. I think she made a mistake and slipped. Sa herself looked pretty disappointed as well.


Climber | Hold
- | -
Kim | Top
Noguchi | 40+
Sa | 37+
Ito | 36+
Lee | 23+
Marlenova | 12+


Final standings :
Climber | Speed | Boulder | Lead | Points
-|-|-|-|-
Noguchi | 6 | 1 | 2 | 12
Sa | 1 | 4 | 3 | 12
Kim | 5 | 3 | 1 | 15
Ito | 4 | 2 | 4 | 32
Marlenova | 2 | 6 | 6 | 72
Lee | 3 | 5 | 5 | 75


I still don't know how tiebreakers work because Noguchi won gold. I thought Sa would win gold based on her first place qual finish but I guess that's not how the rules are written. Also, 2-6-6 looks worse than 3-5-5 but again, that's just how the points are calculated.


The men's finals will start in a bit but I won't be watching that as I have other things to do. My guess is Tomoa gold, Chon silver, Kokoro bronze.",climbing,1535263814,pusherofboxes,2,1,True,2018-08-26

43,Verical mind: a book for climbers who stopped improving and lost having fun,"Climbing is a strange. For me it is purely a hobby, I am not even a good climber by any means, not internationally, not locally, not at my gym and not even among my friends, however it is still a big part of my life and my identity. This has led to numerous problems, for example fear of failure and even unhealthy amount of time spent climbing or training for climbing, to the point where I would feel frustrated to skip a training session to have a beer with friends.

This book will adrress many such problems and ways to overcome these crippling habits. I want to improve my climbing, I also want to have a healthier relationship with my favorite activity and I want to have more fun and less negative emotioms and thoughts when I am out climbimg, so I had a very open mind while reading this book hence it reflected greatly to me. I found many areas to fix on my approach to climbing and life in general with great tips and advices how to achieve that.

It is absolutelly great read that I would recommend to pretty much everyone who is willing to improve their lives or athletic performance. This is a climbing book so most examples are focused on climbing and most issues discussed are climbing related, but almost everything can be translated to any other althletic activity or life in general.

7,"Finally pinpointed the cause of my achey fingers and swollen PIP joints... and it was belaying, not climbing!","Wanted to share my story in case anyone else is suffering. I'll try to keep it as short as possible!

Background:
I have been experiencing some pain and swelling on the fingers of my left hand, focused on the joints rather than the pulleys. During a recent climbing trip it got pretty bad, and I realized something was really off when I couldn't fully close the fingers in my left hand while my right was normal. 

This was frustrating and perplexing because I always warm up thoroughly before climbing, avoid excessive crimping and sketchy pockets, rest often, and take really good care of my fingers on days off. I assumed it was an overuse thing and took a few days off in hopes it would calm down. 

Realization hits:
After a few days off climbing and lots of finger warm ups on the hike in, the first 3 warm ups felt pretty good. On climb 4 my partner tried something harder and took a long fall. As usual, I got lifted off the ground a few feet, but ascended the rope as high as I could so he could boink back to the route. The moment I gripped the rope to pull up on my gri gri, the pain in my left hand came back in full force. It hit me that this was probably the cause and I decided to do a little research. 

After talking to some experienced climbers in my community, I found out that gripping the rope like this puts a lot of force on the collateral ligaments of your joints. This is apparently NO BUENO but it explains my symptoms perfectly. The collateral ligaments are not strengthened by climbing like our pulleys are, so they are very sensitive to injury.

Proposed solution:
The first thing I did was stop ascending the rope and in just a week my left hand already feels way better. However, ascending the rope is still essential when belaying on steep routes, so I've ordered an ascender and will see if that is more comfortable for my joints.  

If anyone has had a similar experience I'd love to hear about it!

TLDR: Recurring pain and joint swelling on left hand (ring and middle fingers). Figured out this is from ascending the rope after catching long falls while lead belaying. No longer ascending rope by hand (instantly alleviated symptoms) and will be trying out belaying with an ascender.",climbing,1534984188,thE_best_cookies,9,1,True,2018-08-22

I'm going on two years of climbing, and I am keen on programming. In an attempt to intersect my hobbies, I have created a climbing app for the Red River Gorge in Kentucky (nearest to home &amp; starting small). This is a route guide app! You may be asking yourselves, ""how is this different than Mountain Project?"" Well, MP has some serious UX flaws, but it makes up for these with its wealth of data. You'll find that my app, ""Redpoint"", greatly improves upon MP's UX, and I've added a feature which allows for users to search for routes based upon climbing style. Do you like slab? Search for slabs! Feeling the need for pump? Search for pumpy! Anyways, this app works great in coordination with MP for an awesome climbing experience.

Yesterday I received 2 pairs of Shadows, 9 and 9.5.  Althought I only traversed for 5 minutes with the 9s, I decided not to keep either one.  Main reason:  they just look cheaply made.  You can see glue residue all over the shoe, kind of like when you glue something on a piece of paper, have put too much glue, and glue comes out when you stick the thing down.  Also, the fit was just plain weird (I understand this is a very personal thing, but still thought worth mentioning):  the mouth of the shoe is very small, so you struggle to get your foot in, not because the shoe itself is tight, but because your foot doesn't fit through the mouth.  Once on, the shoes felt very tight midfoot down, and very big midfoot up.  Also, the heel had a lot of air.

My 2 cents... obviously some people out there love the Shadows, just not for me, and wanted to share.

I could need some advice on how to track my climbing progress, especially regarding to training volume. I used to track the time spend at the gym only but found this doesn't really mean much. Sometimes I belay much more than I climb, sometimes I spend 30min on one crux, sometimes I speed through lot's of easy climbs in that time.

I like the idea of the V-Points in bouldering where you (my understanding) add up the points for each boulder but don't really see how to apply that to rout climbing.

We use UIAA scale in my gym, but I feel just adding up the grades won't work. Climbing an 8 should ""worth more"" than 2 5's in my opinion.

Any thoughts on this, or maybe someone already has come up with a points system I could use?

I've been climbing for about 6 months, bouldering indoors twice or three times per week. My finger joints are often slightly painful in between climbs. I've noticed my knuckles crack a lot more than they used to, and it's a bit disconcerting.
I've been using a stretchy plastic ring device for exercising my fingers, opening rather than closing, as I was under the impression this was an appropriate exercise for generally strengthening the ligaments and supportive tissue. But it's not really helping so far (albeit only a couple of weeks use).
I'm kind of worried I might give myself some kind of arthritis, eventually.

61,Broken Talus (Ankle) Bone,"Last Sunday I slipped on a slab at my local bouldering wall, and my right foot unfortunately hit a giant jug close to the ground before I landed on the mat. As I have hypermobility in my joints and the foot had essentially done a 360, I assumed it was dislocated. Big shock when the X-Ray came back and the nurse tells me I have broken my talus bone. I should find out tomorrow exactly how bad it is and whether I will need surgery. For the time being I'm non-weight bearing; I was too short for the usual armpit crutches, so I'm making do (poorly) with elbow crutches, hopping about with extreme cabin fever.

All the broken talus bone stories I read on the internet are dismal, and I'm terrified. I only started climbing 10 months ago, and I've fallen in love with the sport - I ran track, fell and cross country previously but never felt the same passion or drive to train as I do with climbing now. Emotionally I struggle when I can't exercise, so the next six months to rest-of-my-life will be tough.

Can anyone give me some hope for the future? Even if you had a rough time with a talus break, is there any way you can put a positive spin on your story for me so I can at least have some belief I will recover?

I've been climbing just short of a year now and this summer I've had the most fantastic season. I've gotten outdoors many times, had an amazing trip to Skaha and learned that outdoor climbing is definitely my passion and have gained such a love for this sport its unbelievable! My latest accomplishment was in the gym though, considering I live in Calgary and the bow valley is so close I feel like I should never be talking about training but sometimes you send something that feels so amazing you just have to talk about it. So my partners are all out of town so I've been bouldering a lot the last week and a half. I never boulder as I've been focused on Improving my lead skills as much as possible but when no one is around you gotta do what you gotta do. So this past week I've been working on this problem that is graded c4 which they say is v5-6 territory. I tried this problem 30-40 times total so it's been a struggle to say the least, the first 2 days I kept getting stuck on one move so last night I skipped the start just to work on this move that I was having problems with, I spent around an hour and a half around 20+ attempts to finally get it and after all that work I tried to send it from the start a few times after but was way too pumped to send it. Went back tonight with the soul purpose of sending this problem and on my 3rd attempt I finally sent it! The stoke is so incredible right now and I've gained a whole new appreciation for how amazing bouldering can be for getting better at climbing. These are the type of moments that will keep me coming back for more, I've never struggled on anything as much as this one particular move and it makes me feel with enough grit and determination I can climb anything that I set my mind too. In this first year I've been able to lead some 5.11 and tr some 5.11d at the gym. I've always been of the mindset that 11d might be my limit but with this new injection of stoke and confidence I truly do believe that 5.12 is fully achievable and I'm now laser focused on being able to climb 5.12d by the time next season rolls around. Once again sorry for the boring lame rant, just wanted to tell my story and say that you can send anything that you work on hard enough, all you need is to be determined and work, work, work and never be afraid to fail and never be afraid to ask better climbers for advice as most people are more than happy to help!",climbing,1534656752,Cipekx,0,1,True,2018-08-19

Meeting with the Doc

The urologist explained that I needed to go into this knowing it was not a reversible procedure.  He said that even thought it is reversible, it sometimes is impossible due to the anatomy.  After he inspected my junk, he said I was a good candidate for having the procedure done right there in his office.  There is the option to go to a hospital, where they would fully sedate you, etc, so you CAN do that if you want.  The way I had the procedure done was $500, and it was covered by my insurance.

Without getting too technical, he basically explained make a small incision, find each tube, and for each one (there are two), he would cut the tube, tie it, and cauterize it.  He explained the whole thing would be about 15 minutes, and that the only painful part would be when he clamps and pulls the tubes out so he can do his thing.  He said the pain would be very similar to getting kicked in the nuts.  I have never thought I would feel happy about basically paying someone $500 for kicking me in the nuts twice.  The main thing that stayed with me from this consult was a question he asked me: ""how many kids do you have?""... he didn't ask ""do you have kids?"" ... They need to make sure you are fully committed to this, so once I explained to him our reasons why, I was good to go.  In my research, I read about some doctors making their patients attend a ""class"" to ensure that's what they want, or flat out refuse to do the procedure... makes sense.  

Day before the procedure

Not much to say here other than I manscapped EVERYTHING, and wanted to wait until the day before so it would be nice and fresh. :)  This is something that needs to be done, so if you don't do it yourself, someone will do it for you... I wasn't cool with trusting someone shaving my balls (but somehow I was okay with someone cutting them open... hrmm).

V-day

I went into the room.  I was asked to take off my pants, and lie on a narrow bed.  About 5 minutes later, a female nurse came in and put iodine all over my stuff... it was very, very cold, and yes, it tickled.  Before the iodine, she took 3 strips of, what looked like to me but I'm sure wasn't, masking tape, and she taped my penis to my stomach (to get it out of the way for the procedure).  I know, weird.  A lot of thoughts went through my mind at this moment... thoughts that I will not share here, but you can imagine some of them, I'm sure.

After about 10 minutes of being in the room with my pants down and the cold iodine just getting colder, the doc came in with 2 female nurses.  Hmm.  Ok, whatevs.  He asked if I'm ready... ""any last words?"" he says.  I say no, and he starts.  He used a small needle to numb where the cut was going to be... this didn't hurt at all.  He made the incision, which I did not feel, and started moving stuff around in there.  I could feel stuff moving inside (imagine noodles being moved around, I guess).  He pulls a section of the first tube out, cuts, ties, and cauterizes (I couldn't see, he was talking to me the whole time).  The only part where I felt ""some"" pain (probably 2 out of 10) was when he said I would:  when he had to ""look"" for the tube.  As he told me he was basically done with the first one, I see smoke come up from down here... yes, I saw, and smelled, my balls being cauterized.  Again, no pain during any of this.  He said he was going to try to use the same incision to find the next tube, which he was able to, and basically repeated the first half it all over again.  Before I knew it, it was done.  THE WORST PART of this whole thing was the anticipation of that sharp ""getting kicked in the balls"" pain, which never came... I was afraid I was going to feel the pain hit me, and buckle or something, but nothing.  A mild discomfort here and there, but that was it.  I had my hands over my forehead the whole time, and during the second half of the procedure, I was actually starting to fall asleep a little bit.  He stitched me up, and I was on my way out, on my feet.

The following sections are directly from my phone, as I took notes daily for a few days after the procedure:

V-day:  currently in car.  Pain is similar to the pain that resides after getting kicked in the balls.  3 out of 10.  Throwing up feeling.  Home.  bag of frozen green beans over underwear... doesn't help with pain at all.  7 hours after: no pain.

Day 1 after procedure:  absolutely no pain.  Did I even get anything done?

Day 2:  slight pain, but very milkd (1 out of 10, if that).  Same pain as if shit had been mangled down there, which it technically was.

Day 3:  swollen a bit, no pain.  Interesting feeling walking with balls bigger than what you're used to.  Belayed my friend for 3 hours, then traversed at the end of the gym:  ALL GOOD.

Days following until yesterday:  no pain, swelling going down daily.

Today (9 days after procedure):  I just came back from the rock climbing gym, where I had a full hard session.  Normal warm up, an hour plus of hard bouldering, and 45 minutes of endurance.  Absolutely no pain at all.

The only thing that resides is a slight discomfort when I jump up and down, as if jumping rope... that's it.  I have a follow up this upcoming Friday.

This is all!  Please feel free to ask any questions about the procedure, private message me, etc.  I think vasectomies are a taboo subject, and they shouldn't be.",climbing,1534725459,bryan2384,20,1,True,2018-08-19

473,Adding bolts to established routes.,"I've been climbing for about 2 years now and - though I'm still a noob - been noticing that many of the routes on the crags near my city are very poorly bolted.

When I watch videos of climbers from around the world, there's usually a bolt every 5 or so feet (1.5m). Here? A bolt every 10 is considered too many. It's normal to have bolts every 15ft.

My question is, is it considered normal to add bolts to established routes?

The one route that triggered this question was a pretty easy route, a french 6b (yds 5.10d). Despite the low grade, I shit my pants every time I go up this route and have seen two falls in the crux, and they were particularly nasty ones. I don't have a good picture of the route, but hopefully my Paint skills are enough.

https://imgur.com/a/exPcXA5 - This is cross-section of the route.

The crux is from the 2nd to the 3rd bolt, and if you lose your footing during a crux move, not only are you dragged down the slab by gravity, you also hit the plateau, and then fall some more.

Also, the land (and therefore, the crag) is owned by this older gentleman who is kind enough to let us climb there. If there was an accident, he could be held liable. It would be stupid to sue the man, but stupid lawsuits happen all the time and are sometimes won. Why put the man at risk?

When searching for an answer, I found [this thread](https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/105918285/adding-bolts-to-established-lines) from 2007 saying it's big no no, but it's also from 11 years ago. Hopefully the opinion has changed.

If you argue that the answer is still ""No"", mind elaborating? The two main arguments seem to be: 1 - the mental challenge is an addition to the physical one; and 2 - tradition. I don't understand either. You can always choose no to clip a quickdraw if you want the mental challenge (much like one can free solo a route with bolts) and [tradition is a stupid thing in general](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2ar5s3/what_is_a_tradition_that_everyone_follows_that/). If you say ""No"", please elaborate on the why not.

58,Obscure request: Gym rec's with great auto-belay routes? [US specific],"Hello all.

I am a fairly new climber, but I often travel for work (sales) so I find myself in random cities on a regular basis. Since I am usually solo on my trips, I often pay for day passes at nearby climbing gyms to have a few hours of fun. Being a solo climber, I'm limited to auto belay routes and bouldering.

The crowd here seems to be well dispersed, so I was hoping anyone could chime in with recommendations for climbing gyms (within the lower 48) that have particularly interesting or challenging routes with auto belays.

I can usually tackle 5.9-5.10 routes, so I'm always on the lookout for routes in this difficulty range that present a nice challenge.

My hope is that there are some gyms out there that have particularly high routes (beyond 40ft) or varying pitches (within reason, given how an auto belay works).

Thanks in advance.

60,Reverso vs Jul(giga/mega) vs atc guide vs dmm pivot,"I've been using the atc guide for multi pitch the past 2 years mostly for rappeling and not belaying and i've recently buyed a double rope to go on more diverse and alpine multi pitch route.

Since i was using a single rope i'm using the grigri for the autolock which is handy you never know a fall can happen or a rock and the second can be knocked out.

Now that i have a double rope i would love to use an autolock like the mega/gigajul. But it doesnt seem too great from the review. 
The problem with the atc/reverso and pivot is the absence of autolock. 
The jul family autolock and i would prefer something like that but it seems a bit shitty to rappel with. 

Does anyone knows when the gigajul is supposed to be available ? It looks clumsy maybe the megajul is enough.

2. What length? I'm imagining as long as my climbing rope (70m). (I hear some people rig the base of their static line away from the cliff (e.g. on a tree) to get them away from the rock, which would imply a rope potentially longer than the climbing rope is necessary, but it seems unlikely I'll be both in this situation and be photographing a 70m route. 
3. What brand/model? I have 100' of Sterling HTP that I use for static anchors that I like, so I was looking at that, and also Mammut Performance Static rope (love their infinity/eternity dynamic ropes).

29,Click Up Plus - Initial impressions,"I recently got the new Click Up Plus belay device and thought I'd share my experience with it so far.

---

**Some background:**  
I mostly top-rope indoors in a gym with a good variety in ropes (some are fairly worn 11mm ropes others are fairly new 8.5mm). I had the original Click Up before and have used the GriGri, Micro Jul and Atc plus before.

I prefered the Click Up for combining comfort, ease of use and assisted breaking. But given some of the thicker ropes in the gym, the original Click Up was definitely pretty hard work on some of the ropes (both for giving out slack and taking in slack). Lowering someone to the ground has always been an absolute dream on the Click Up; by far the best device for it that I've used.

---

**Experience with the Click Up +:**  

* Top Rope: Thicker ropes are much easier to work with. Even the thickest ropes in the gym are pretty easy to work with (this surprised me a little as the official difference is only .5mm). Narrower ropes are also fine and assisted breaking works perfectly on both.
* Lead: Minimal experience with lead so far, only a little on narrower nopes. But on narrower ropes it's mostly the same as the original Click Up (that is to say, smooth for paying out rope, easy to use and excellent assisted breaking).

Other notes; one other thing that's kind of been an annoyance with the original Click Up was that when hanging the device + carabiner off a harness loop it would sometimes get tangled and be somewhat annoying to untangle.

Just recently listened to enormocast where this issue was discussed, and the conclusion that the climbers agreed on was that being lowered is always safer for steep single pitch sport climbs.

6,achey shoulder after climbing,"For the last 2 months or so I have been getting this sort of dull ache on the back of my left shoulder (thinking like teres minor/infraspinatus area). It doesn't ""hurt"" per se and there is no apparent loss of mobility or strength. It just doesn't feel right. It seems to come and go, occasionally radiating a sort of numb feeling down my left arm/hand.

It began after a hard gym bouldering session in which I was repeatedly (10+ times) doing a very long left hand reach to a jug on a steep overhang. The move basically had me fully weighting my left arm while it was stretched out very far. I can see how this movement could have caused me to pull one of my posterior rotator cuff muscles, as I was not ""plugging in"" my shoulder while weighting it.

Anyways after it did not go away despite taking it easy and avoiding overhangs for a couple weeks, I took a month off climbing completely. During this time, I got some resistance bands and have been doing rotator cuff exercises daily. This has seemed to improve my overall shoulder stability (which is slightly wonky due to a shoulder separation about 5 years ago), but today was my first day back climbing and the feeling is the same as before.

Anybody have any experience with symptoms like this? Additionally, what type of doctor would I go to to get it checked out? I have a very good PPO through work, so I can skip the GP and go straight to an orthopedist or PT if needed. Unsure though whether a PT is able to order an MRI or diagnose a more non-healing injury like a SLAP tear.

I think with my current routine I can get up to sending one grade higher, but i have a feeling I will plateau there. I’m not overweight, but not super lean either.

The problem is I am having trouble deciding which one. I have done some research and based on internet comments this is my understanding of what books are available and the pros and cons of each.

* The Supertopo Book: Pros: excellent approach and descent beta, has plenty of climbs to keep you busy for a week. Cons: older, some information may be dated, less detailed typos

* The Reid Guide: Pros: tons of climbs and excellent tops. Cons: older, some information may be dated, less approach beta than supertopo out of print so can be expensive. 

* The new book (Sloan): Pros: new, comes with a free app. Cons: heavy, filler information, not enough detail in the book itself. 

My first question is: has anyone used the new book with the app? if so, is the app any good? does it make up for the stated shortcomings in the book? Is the app any better than just supplementing the supertopo or Reid guide with Mountain project?

Secondly, does anyone who has spent extensive time in the Valley and seen all three books have a recommendation for me as to what to do? I definitely do not want to buy all three books, but I am open to buying two if it will keep me from getting super lost looking for climbs or getting stranded at the top looking for the descent.

I made [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jahepi.whipper) for Android that allows you to calculate the forces that appear on a climbing fall.

The idea of creating this app comes from wondering how much resistance actually is 22kN on a carabiner, or how much forces do we create when falling on our protection gear. I first made an Excel and as I was learning programming I decided do create an app about it. Some friends liked it so I thought maybe it could be interesting for more people.

Spoiler: Gear is bomber and usually you will break the stone where protection is placed before the protection piece. It's safer for our gear falling 10 meters when you already climbed 30 meters than falling 2 meters when you climbed 3 meters.

The app is free, it doesn't have any advertisement and weights only 1.6M. It has a Spanish and English version, and metric or imperial units. If you were wondering about this, no, I don't get any profit from this (I doubt I could haha)

I'd love if you gave me some feedback on the design, usability, typos and specially gramar and vocabulary mistakes on the English version (I'm not a native English speaker). Any other suggestions will be welcome too! If you have any questions, I'll be glad to answer.  
If you are more interested on it or if you want to collaborate with me, PM me. :)

I'm thinking of attempting Skywalker next week. Never been to Squamish before. I lead max 5.8 in Val David (Quebec) and have led a few in the Gunks. Sport i can lead to 5.11 usually. First trad season.

[Sterling Osprey](https://sterlingrope.com/store/work/hardware/carabiners-snaphooks/osprey)

[Trango Regulock](http://www.trango.com/p-231-regulock-hms-screwlock.aspx)

[Metolius Element](https://www.metoliusclimbing.com/element_belay_carabiner.html)

**Extended explanation** I have a Mega Jul belay device and I love it. It works great for belaying lead or top rope, and I haven't had any trouble rappelling either. However, all of the reviews say that guide mode is shit, and I can elaborate on that.

Guide mode on the device is shit when you're using a carabiner with a modern I or H profile. It tremendously increases the friction on the rope causing the difficulties the reviews all mention. I also learned that the profile makes lowering inconsistent and jerky.

I had a much better guide mode experience when I tried using my 10mm quick link in the rope loop. This comes with it's own problems though: a) it's a lot of heavy steel that I don't need for any other purpose on multipitch trad, which is where I'd be using guide mode and b) quicklinks aren't large enough to use as recommended by the manufacturer with the gate inside the wire loop.

I tried a BD Rocklock locker for it, but the spine is not round and if you use it the long way with the smooth side on the device it's too large to fit in the belay loop.

Hoping that someone has experience with some of the ones I linked.

&gt;Inb4 ""get a grigri"" or ""buy a reverso/atc guide."" I like being able to dual strand rappel and lock off on the same device.

66,Back tightness limiting grip strength,"TLDR: Years of lifting and climbing with no stretching gave me super tight back muscles. They started impinging on my nerves and making it impossible to grip things. PT/stretching has helped, but only partly. Does anyone have any experience with this/advice? Also, if you don't stretch, you really really should!


I started climbing a couple years ago, after spending a lot of time lifting. I had very bad upper body mobility, although I didn't know it at the time. About a year ago, I started to notice that my grip strength in my right hand was noticeably weaker than my left, and I got pumped almost as soon as I started a climbing session. As this became more noticeable, I thought I needed to get stronger, so I started hangboarding more, and it kept getting worse. This culminated in tingling and numbness in my right hand.


At this point, a doctor diagnosed me with Carpal tunnel, which was wrong. A month later, I went to PT, where they gave me some stretches and things immediately started to improve. I could literally feel my nerves reactivating in my hand as a stretched my back. 3ish months of PT and very consistent stretching has helped immensely, but I think I've plateaued. If anyone has dealt with anything similar, I'd love to hear your stories. I'm back to bouldering at a V5/V6 level, and I can climb 5.11ish, but I'm still getting pumped really fast in my right hand.",climbing,1533740071,kinnunenenenen,26,1,True,2018-08-08

41,5 Biomechanical Tips to Improve Climbing Technique,"Hey r/Climbing!

I recently wrote an article on 5, simple biomechanically-based tips to improve climbing technique. As a coach and personal trainer, these are the biggest issues I see in most climber's technique. While it is by no means exhaustive and will not apply to every situation, I hope that this list will get you thinking about your own biomechanics. I've included a few exercises you can perform during a warm-up to assist in activation as well as getting the brain and body talking.

I've been bouldering for about a year now (went from v0 up to most recently v3). I'm female and pretty small, so I mainly just climb for fun and to meet interesting folks. 

I took a pretty bad fall in the gym a few weeks ago. The wall was slightly overhung, and for some reason when I fell I wasn't upright and couldn't get my feet under me in time. I hit the mat pretty hard from right near the top of the wall - maybe 10 feet I'd estimate. Just kind of crashed down onto my arm/side with a fair amount of whiplash. I had a headache after and was sore for a few days. 

Now I'm finding myself too scared to climb even v0 jugs. I keep thinking about the fall and can't get past the ""barrier"" of trusting smaller footholds, lunging for a far-away hold, etc. I'm pretty bummed because I love climbing. This has definitely taken the joy out of it. 

How do you get back your focus and mental psych after a fall? I know falling in the gym and not outside is way less intense but for some reason it's still getting to me.

32,Replacing a gym rope,"Hi. So my partner and I disagree on whether or not it's time to replace our gym rope. We bought it from our old climbing gym where they sold us a 130' chunk off of a spool. It's one of those 9.5 mm Sterling  dynamic lead/gym ropes that's made to take a beating. We got it five  years ago. We've used it on average 2x/week since then. In all that  time, we've probably only taken a handful of falls on it each.   


The  rope seems fine and shows no signs of wear outside of what would be  expected. There's nothing that shouts it should be immediately replaced  (core shot, fraying, etc). It does seem much more supple then when we  first got it, but that's to be expected.  I've been told to replace your ropes every five years regardless of the amount of falls you've taken on it.

I am interested in upgrading to a Nikon B700, but I'm concerned that the bulk of it may be annoying, especially on climbing trips. Anyone who has experience with this, I'm curious of how it feels to carry a larger camera on your approach and on the climb itself (those top out pictures are what I really love). Any advice would be great!

9,Addressing safety issues with climbing partners,"Hi All,

First time poster here. Been getting into climbing, mostly indoor. Grabbed a bunch of friendly guys from my gym, took them outdoor for some fun &amp; games.

They aren't the safest bunch however.

1. Unlocked caribiners setup multiple times by leader at top of climb (to be used for top roping)
2. Single biner setup for toprope anchor on one bolt
3. Rapping through hangers instead of rap ring
4. Belayer with ATC round the wrong way
5. Belayer with ATC, hand not on brake rope multiple times when belaying leader. No gloves, chatting to buddies on ground
6. No helmets and don't want to use Grigri or other autolock device. If hit by rock and belayer knocked out, climber can deck (happened to my friend previously)
7. Some old gear (3+ year ropes &amp; draws) that is still being used - problem?

These guys are really friendly and good 5.11b+ climbers. How should I approach these issues with them without being too confrontational?

16,Finger injury rehab question,"Around mid January, I reinjured an old finger pully (I know, this is absolutely idiotic) by squeezing a shampoo bottle too hard. I was already out of climbing for a few months at this time due to a sprained thumb, and let it rest for a decent amount longer than the original injury. I did go to an orthopedic about it as well, but was told that since nothing was broken or severely torn, he couldn't really do anything and I just had to rest it. So, I give it untill around late April-Early May-ish, and the sharp pain I had with the injury had subsided. I started trying to rehab it, primarily by using stress ball type things, but it seems like i've been stuck there. Anytime I try to do any sort of pull-up, while I don't get that same sharp pain, it feels really weak and achey afterwords. This feeling also occurs when I try to push the rehab much beyond the same thing i've been doing for a few months, just squeezing a stress ball and stretching.  This didn't really happen with the first injury, which I think may be because I was more careful and paranoid of further reinjury this time around, making it loose more strength. Does anyoe have any experience with this type of issue? Is that feeling normal and i'm just being a worrywort, or is it something else?",climbing,1532923018,npapa17,6,1,True,2018-07-29

My injuries aren't all that bad. I know people have come back from much more serious injuries than these - but I'm struggling with these! I tore my rotator cuff skiing several years ago and my left shoulder/arm have never been the same. I'm working on rebuilding that strength and taking it slow. I've also recently broke my right thumb which has me out of climbing for at least another month, as I do PT for that. 

Unfortunately for my climbing (but fortunately for everything else) life has just happened since my shoulder injury - having met a girl, married her, bought a house and adopted a very active dog. Climbing rehab just hasn't been as high a priority as I would like to make it - and I now know I need to make it a priority for my own mental health.

So - What made your rehab successful? What helped you 'replace' climbing while you were out? How do you feel now that you're back climbing?

* Food?  I am allergic to lobster, but look forward to murdering several hundred fried clams on this trip.
* How are the belay areas on Precipice/South Wall? We'll climb at Otter cliffs, but it's stressful having a toddler at the top of a cliff line.  
* We'll mostly be doing single pitch stuff, but both boys love to do multi-pitch when we can.  Any suggestions for longer (2-3 pitch) **well-protected** climbs in the ~5.7 range?  I'm not so into run out climbing with two kids in tow.  Gunklandia looks rad, but MP makes it sound like maybe the chimney at the end is a bit spicy.
* Good 2-3 pitch routes that can be done as a single pitch and belayed from the top?
* Must-do stuff?  I dunno about grades because I've heard a lot of sandbag warnings, but you hear those everywhere. Generally comfortable in the 5.8-5.10 range in old school areas, but always skip those 5.9+ bastards.
* Easy slabs anywhere?  The 4 year old loves an easy slab.

74,Help with a finger injury,"Today I was trying a 7A-7B boulder problem with a long right hand reach to a small crimp. While I was reaching for it my foot slipped and I only got 3 fingers to the crimp and my hand slipped from the hold so that it hurt my right ring finger.

It didn't hurt too much at the time but after that holding onto anything else (even jugs) hurt so I stopped climbing immediately. There is very little swelling and when resting it doesn't hurt at all. I can move and use it without.

After 2 days it doesn't hurt at all even when hanging from a pull up bar. Gently crimping also doesn't hurt but when applying more pressure it starts to hurt a bit.

I had a similar injury (which happened in an almost identical situation) in my left ring finger. I visited a doctor back then and she said it would be OK to continue climbing but advised to take it easy. It continued to hurt a bit while crimping and in slopers but the pain disappeared completely after a 2 week break from climbing.

My question is this:

1.) Can I continue climbing as long as it does not hurt?

2.) I will be visiting a doctor soon but I doubt that he won't take further tests unless I demand it. I'm worried it could be a A2 pulley or something so should I just demand an X-ray to be sure?

40,Pain as diagnostic of injury (or what to do after injury stops hurting?),"While climbing a slab at the gym 2 days ago pulling onto a high left foot, my left hip popped as joints sometime do under strain (i.e. unexpectedly and with intensity; when I crack my knuckles normally it's a pretty low intensity sensation). I had no pain and didn't really think anything of it. About 20 minutes later I was on another route with a (somewhat) high left foot and as I placed the foot and moved my weight over it I felt a kind of grinding + popping feeling in my hip joint, and I immediately dropped off the wall. After that my hip felt extremely uncomfortable and pain was setting in.

For the past two days I've had pain when mobilizing the joint causing me to slightly limp. It's been difficult to lift my foot to get in/out of the shower or put on pants/socks from a standing position. However, the pain has been gradually subsiding, and I only really feel pain when my thigh hits 90 degrees. I walk without a limp but if I walk fast then I feel low level pain and like my gait/range of motion is inhibited.

Since it's a weekend I can't get to the doctor for at least a day or more. My concern is that by the time I'm referred to a PT or ortho or whatever appropriate specialist, I'll be back near 0% pain and 100% function without having resolved what happened, if it's likely to recur, and if I might be unwittingly damaging something (e.g. if it's a labral tear). So my question is, how important is pain and impairment in doctors diagnosing an injury or even considering it a serious possibility? In other words, if the pain subsides and function returns, am I no longer injured?

(Note: Regardless of what happens I plan on taking it easy and exercising caution around high left feet for awhile whenever I return to climbing.)",climbing,1532875711,dzbee,10,1,True,2018-07-29

26,From calisthenics to climbing...friendly discussion?,"Hey all,

I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the correct place or not, but I want to have a discussion around this topic instead of just simple Q&amp;A.  

I came from years of calisthenics training and never climbed until Jan 1st, 2018 (my new year's resolution to try something new).  Since then, I've become obsessed with gym climbing because of how similar it is to calisthenics training, but so much more practical and fun.  After almost 7 full months of climbing, I'm able to crush a few V5's and flash almost everything below that.  I'm 160lbs, 13% body fat, and 6' with wingspan of 6'2"".  I've realized that my biggest hurdle for improving is my finger strength.  When it comes to pull ups and raw power, I'm very strong.  But doing 1 arm pull ups won't help much if you can't lock off on a bad crimp at the crux of a hard route.  I'm trying to incorporate more hangboard and campus board into my training, but I know developing strong fingers is a long process.  Like my buddy said, it's like a fine wine that gets better as it ages.  Now, I'm sort of curious about this -

I still train in a normal gym 2 days a week because I want to keep power and to offset all the pulling motions I do with things like pushups and dumbbell press and weighted dips.  Also, I want to keep a slim and cut physique so I run a lot and do TONS of planks and sit ups and deadlifts.  I noticed some really good climbers in my gym have very little muscle definition which I assume is a result of starting when they were younger so they have the tendon/ligament maturity, but not as much raw power (opposite of me I think).  I wonder if I'm wasting my time at the other gym when I should just be focusing on climbing more and avoiding weights.

(I'm a guy)

I have been looking around but having trouble finding a harness that fits. It seems I have a somewhat thinner waist but regular legs. This means that when i tighten the waist i need to tighten it all the way.

Yeasterday I tried (and bought) a https://arcteryx.com/se/en/shop/womens/ar-385a-harness (which is the womens model of https://arcteryx.com/se/en/shop/mens/ar-395a-harness). 

It fits good and felt ok when I tried hanging in the store. The difference is that the womens model is about one size down in waist but with the same leg size. Just what I need.

    Men Medium: Waist 81 - 88, Leg 58 - 62
    Women Medium: Waist 74 - 81, Leg 58 - 62

The only differencce I find according to the description is that ""The longer belay loop accommodates a women’s differential between waist and leg loops"". 

When I tried it I don't think I noticed any difference but I'm a bit unsure if it will something that I will notice when I climb with it going forward?

Any other guys here that have experience using ""specific womens"" harnesses or any other input?

My performance shoes are the La Sportiva Skwama, and they're the most comfortable of all so far, but they also put a lot of pressure on the nails of my hammertoes, causing them to thicken and become even more uncomfortable.

So I’m a fairly flexible fellow, I can raise my knees up to the point where they can touch my chest. This flexibility is especially useful on slabby and vert climbs, and especially climbs with high feet. 

Now for the actual story: I was on a climb at my colleges gym, nothing too tough but the climb did have a tricky high foot. This high foot also happened to be fairly close to my waist. Now I’m a bit of a hung guy, and in this case I happened to be just long enough for the unthinkable to happen: while on the climb, as I lifted my foot real high and close in to my waist to step on the hold, my dick happened to find it’s way in between my foot and the hold, and I ended up stepping on my own penis. Thankfully, no long term injury was sustained, however it hurt like hell.

63,Anyone ever have this injury?,"Not a climbing specific injury but I thought this would be a good place to ask.

Many years ago I used to do pullups with weights around my waist (I worked up to 120lbs at a bodyweight of 160).   I started getting pain in my left upper tricep (basically where the top of the tricep and bottom of the rear delt meets.  A little to the left of the top of my armpit).

Work and Family has made working out very tough so I haven't really worked out in many many years (still weigh about the same).  But occasionally I have gone to the gym and done pulldowns (only around 80lbs) and after about 10 reps that injury area starts to burn and ache.

Last week (again not working out at all) I took the kids to the park and did 3 pullups and for a few days afterward that injury area was hurting.

What type of injury could it be?  I'm thinking its a tiny tear of some ligament or tendon, but which one?

Its never bothered me around the time of my yearly physical so I've never brought it up to my doctor, but I've mentioned it on a weight lifting forum I used to go to and it was received by chorus' of ""Pullups workout the lats and bicepts NOT the triceps""

Researching around on the internet, I found an old post by someone who said that the triceps brachii is also used for movements like pullups.

I bought the rope in 2013 and put it in my closet for the next 5 years. Summer came and I got bored of bouldering and decided to switch things up. After spending a couple hours a day looking for information about ropes in my situation I came to the conclusion that a 9 year old rope is still safe to fall on but, it is not as safe as a fresh rope. It took me climbing on it 3 times a week for about 2 months to core shot the rope. I noticed a fuzzy spot(that was not there last go) before tying in, took a few falls and on the lower, saw the core. Old good condition ropes will catch some falls but don't expect to get the full life out of it like you would a new rope.

Total distance: 32km
Total elevation: 1800m+
Total hiking time: 22.5 hours
Temps: high 6 degrees Celsius at Geehi, low -15 degrees Celsius at 3am at Moira’s Flat

Story:
As part of my holiday I decided to do a solo trip up to Mt. Kosciuszko, the highest point of the Australian continent, via Hannels Spur. This route has been described as legendary and is Australia’s highest vertical ascent. After 6 months of planning and preparation, I made my drive to Geehi Flat. I got started much later than I anticipated due to having to stop and sleep at a rest stop after driving through the monotonous Aussie outback, and having to backtrack nearly 70km because I forgot to buy fuel for my jetboil. 

My hike began at 1330hrs AEST. At the start of the hike I noticed a couple of wallabies staring at me as if I was some crazy guy trampling through their territory. I followed some tracks made by vehicle for a couple hundred meters before realizing that I wasn’t following the appropriate route. I then backtracked to find the correct path and told myself that I would need to pay closer attention to the gps if I didn’t want to get myself lost. 
Soon I came across the Geehi River which needed to be crossed. Excitedly I stopped to remove my shoes and roll up my pants. The river was about 50m wide, knee deep, and nearly ice cold with lots of smooth and slippery stones. Once on the West Bank, I replaced shoes and socks and proceeded about another 500m before coming across the official Hannels Spur sign. 

From there the terrain changed into thick brush and steep hill. A short way in I felt as though I had entered an ancient fern and eucalyptus forest and could possibly encounter a dinosaur. The only life to speak of, however, were the forest birds with enchanting songs and spiders with their webs strung across a barely identifiable path. Prior trekkers had kindly flagged the route with fluorescent pink flags making it almost too easy to stay on course. 
Soon it started getting dark and I hadn’t yet gotten my fill of hiking. I pulled out my headlamp and decided to try my nighttime trail tracking skills. This went better than I expected except for a couple parts where the brush was so thick that finding the brightly colored flags was impossible. I pulled out the gps and once again found the faint evidence of footsteps and thus the trail. Soon I reached the snow line and the crushed plants that I was following were concealed by the slushy snow. I was pretty tired at this point and decided that I would push on until application of snow shoes became necessary. This happened at around 2030hrs and so I stopped at a comfortable and relatively flat spot. I made camp underneath a few arched boughs of acacia and boiled some snow to heat up my meal of Sirena tuna with brown rice and quinoa. After dinner was finished, I took a look at my thermometer and it read a bone chilling -6 degrees Celsius. This was mitigated with my -20degree Fahrenheit sleeping bag and alpine bivy - toasty! Before sleeping I decided to check my phone and I found something I’d never encountered on such a remote hike - cell service. I called the family, wished them good night, and called it a day!

Morning rolled around and soon the light through the treetop canopy became too much to sleep through. I got up and packed my stuff while melting snow and boiling the water for coffee. Once packed, fueled and hydrated, I donned my snowshoes and began hiking at around 0930hrs. Shortly thereafter, I came across Moira’s Flat and the sign stating that I had only traveled about 6km on my first day and had another 9km to go to the top of Kosi, not to mention the return trip. I knew I had a long day ahead. I pushed on and was soon greeted by beautiful vistas of the clouds and rolling hills below me as well as fewer thick bushes. The trees and brush soon gave way to beautiful alpine scenery with nothing but snow and mountains. This was a welcome relief but I now had a new enemy - exposure. The wind picked up and the sun attacked from above and below as its rays reflected off the snow. I had to pay special attention to clothing management to keep myself warm enough without sweating and at the same time protect myself from the sun and wind. 

A short while later the winds increased and it felt as though the temperature had dropped. It had gotten so cold that my iPhone/gps was too cold to function. I had to pull out the good old map and compass. This is something I hadn’t been forced to do in the past but it felt good to know that I had planned for this and that I was prepared. Once I had identified Abbot Peak and Peak 2159 I was able to triangulate my position and determine a heading. Soon I came over the Abbot Ridge and had a beautiful view of Kosi across the big snowy valley. Muellers Pass was my next waypoint and it appeared to be a lot closer than it actually was. Once there, I was able to identify parts of the Summit Walk track across the valley on the north face of the Etheridge Ridge and saw the first people I had seen in a couple days, granted they were a couple kilometers away. Seeing them inspired me to pickup my pace to make the summit before they did. Heading South and even more exposed without the shelter of rocks and hills, the wind picked up to about 40km/h. As I approached the last turn towards Kosi, I came across a couple more hikers who were setting up tents  behind some rocks sheltered from the wind. I asked where they had started and the said they started in Thredbo - a mere 6.5km hike from Kosi. Cheaters, I thought to myself. In any case, I didn’t want to spend much time chatting as I had come to the realization that I needed to get back to the car before 0930 the following morning as that’s when my KNP pass would expire. 

I finally reached the summit at 1248hrs. As I approached, I took a couple videos and a few pictures to document my remarkable achievement and immediately turned around for the long return journey. Instead of following the same route back, I looked straight over to the part of Abbot ridge where I had crossed over into the snowy valley and made a B-line straight down the Western face of Kosciusko figuring this would save me about an hour of walking. The reason this was possible was the amount of snow under which many of the rocks and boulders were covered. This worked out great. I came across some markers and began to follow them thinking that they were the markers for Hannels Spur which I hadn’t seen earlier. After a while I grew concerned that it wasn’t exactly taking me where I needed to go as I hadn’t seen any of my tracks. By this time, my phone had warmed up enough to use 
by being directly against my skin inside of my shirt. I saw that I was too far South of my initial route and headed North toward the way from which I came. No problem, I thought, I’d be back on the trail in no time. Wrong. Somehow on the way up I’d managed to cross Wilkinson’s Creek without even realizing it, but, with my modified route, I had to cross it and another creek. Realizing the danger of getting wet in these conditions and at this time, I inspected the limited assortment of snow bridges very carefully and thoroughly and made my choice. As I approached the first snow bridge I could hear the sound of water flowing beneath me. I used the two eucalyptus walking sticks I had picked up along the ascent to poke the snow ahead of me to determine the depth of the snow and solidity of the ice that supported the snow. As I crossed the snow bridge, I did so cautiously and with as much haste as I could without breaking the refrozen top surface of snow. Phew! I made over the first snow bridge, and then the second, like a heavy boxer floating in a fight across the boxing ring. 

By this time the daylight was quickly fading and dusk was setting in. As I looked to the south I could see the clouds being quickly blown in my direction. I picked up my pace and was soon back on the Hannels Spur trail, but hadn’t yet seen my previous tracks. I realized that this was the area that I had gone through earlier with a frozen phone and was navigating by compass. I decided that since my phone was working now, I would continue to navigate by gps. I had to be extra careful to keep my phone warm for if it froze again I would no longer be able to navigate in the dark without visible landmarks and would have to stay in place overnight. This wouldn’t be ideal because it was really windy on this open plain. Luckily, I was able to make it down to the tree line and found my tracks. It was here that I decided to push as far as I could - perhaps all the way back to the car. 
After pushing through the mix of wattle and snowgums then acacia, again, I arrived at Moira’s Flat. By this point it was 2000hrs and I was hungry. I decided to heat up some dinner. Initially this was just going to be a pit stop and I would carryon afterwards, but I started to get cold while waiting for the food to heat up. I then decided that I would stay the night in this nice flat and sheltered area. I got to boiling some water to heat up my food and found that I was running low on fuel. I had only enough for dinner and a hot drink and melted about 600ml of water before I was out of fuel. I thought to myself that perhaps this would be enough. I didn’t want to search for water in the dark  and get my hands wet and cold. I figured that I could make the 600ml last another 6km and be just fine. 
It got cold... really cold. Each time I rolled over in my bag I would feel the cold air rush in and down my face. In an attempt to plug the hole I would cover up again and I felt as though I was suffocating. Finally, I’d had enough. I looked at my clock and it was 3am. I decided that I need to get up and moving in order to be back at the car on time. When I opened my bivy, I discovered that I’d been encased in a layer of ice crystals. I checked the thermometer. It was -15 degrees Celsius. I reach for my boots and found them frozen solid as a rock. I think it was the struggle to get the boots on that kept me warm once out of the bag. I packed all my gear, downed some trail mix, and carried on. It wasn’t long before I had passed my previous camp. Soon dawn was breaking and I could turn off my headlamp. Heading down was easier because I was following my own tracks. Eventually I reached the snow line transition and removed my boots. I drank down my last gulp of water and continued on. I realized that I was thirstier than I had imagined with still 3.5km to go. I figured that my next water would be at the Geehi River crossing. I had no choice but to carry on. 

Eventually I reached the Geehi River and viewed it as my oasis. Excitedly, I filled up a bottle of water and pulled out my filter. I attached the filter to the bottle and squeezed... nothing. My filter was still frozen solid. By this time the temps were still hanging around -1 degree Celsius and the only way I could unfreeze the filter was by keeping it close to my body. I stuck the filter in my armpit as I got ready to cross the river. This river crossing was definitely not as comfortable nor as enjoyable as the first time. Almost as soon as I stepped into the water my toes and feet screamed pain, then pins and needles, and then numbness. The 50m across the river seemed about twice as far as the first. Once across, I didn’t even bother to dry my feet before quickly putting my socks and boots back on. I also neglected to replace my pants as I still had on long johns which I had rolled up for the crossing and quickly rolled down again. I got going as quick as I could as this and hiking in the sun would adequately warm me up again. The filter still hadn’t thawed and I decided that I could drink when back at the car. Soon I was back and could now call this adventure a success. It was 10am and 0 degrees when I finished. The windshield, like I this morning, was layered with ice and needed defrosting. Once warmed up I began my 600km drive back to Sydney. 

I must say that this is probably the most difficult of the big mountains I’ve climbed. The reason for this is the overgrown shrubs and often hidden trail. If I were to do this again, I would definitely bring a machete.

I know it's going to be extremely hot during the day, I was thinking I'd do a morning session (sunrise-9:30ish) and an evening session (5/6-sunset).

Any and all recommendations are welcome!  Best areas, rest day activities, how to make the most of a month as a beginner, etc.",climbing,1532021781,OneOfTheOnlies,16,1,True,2018-07-19

24,"My first alpine multipitch. ""Luftige Kante"" (IV), Kreuzwandspitze, Karwendel","I started sport climbing a little over 2 years ago, and I have wanted to do a real alpine multipitch for pretty much all this time. Unfortunately, my climbing partner has no experience and the people who had the experience were a) always busy and b) told me to not go unless it was with someone with experience in the alpine. So I waited, and 3 weeks ago Travis joined our sport climbing group and we chatted for a bit at the crag, eventually agreeing to go to the Karwendel at the next opportunity. [This is him](https://imgur.com/WrzVxap) at the shore of the Starnberger See the evening before. We were fortunate enough to find people willing to host us for a night so we didn't have to drive all the way the day of the climb, shoutouts to Julia and Will for being really generous like that, even though we are basically strangers. [Here's another picture](https://imgur.com/0h4fhmY) of the lake at sunset, almost worth the trip on its own.

After a night that was way too short and way too long all in one, we started off towards the mountains at 6AM. 7:15AM, we start from the parking lot. I was told this climb has a nice and short approach. I was not prepared for what that meant. [This is the very first part of it](https://imgur.com/PKDOpdN). A paved road, on a 40-45 degree incline, for what felt like half a mile straight up the mountain. I was soaked after 5 minutes. On the plus side, this is already like 5% of the approach, so, you know, silver linings. The approach eases off a little after that, and the [scenery](https://imgur.com/4W4vF4x) [becomes](https://imgur.com/vTX0rQW) [increasingly](https://imgur.com/s854Ivy) [breathtaking](https://imgur.com/lNXX2hz). I wish I could appreciate it more, but all my energy is focused on keeping my pulse below 180. After about another hour of what I'm pretty sure constitutes a war crime against my quadriceps, we reach the [Dammkarhütte](https://imgur.com/YRrjlBJ). 

Pretty soon after, the trail is gone and we're scrambling up what used to be a glacier and is now [a minefield of broken ankles waiting to happen](https://imgur.com/PVCZOjf). By now, my body is kind of getting used to the abuse, and the pain signals reach my consciousness only infrequently. You take what you can get. We spot about 10 parties queueing on the MaMa-Kante, the climb we originally wanted to do, and we keep going to the [""Luftige Kante""](https://imgur.com/ld9KMph), an easier and shorter climb (12 pitches of up to V compared to 8 pitches of IV and easier). Normally, my pride would object, but the way I'm feeling right now, I don't know if I can even put on my harness, let alone climb something even remotely challenging while also carrying a backpack.

So now, after a total of 3 hours driving and another 2.5 hours of approach, we get to climb! Well, Travis does, he's going to lead all the pitches. Oh, and he forgot his helmet in the car. Setting a great example here, Trav. We go through the commands once again to make sure, and then he sets off. He reaches the first belay, pulls the rope through, and I start climbing. About 25 feet later, he yells ""On belay!"". Oops. The climbing itself isn't anything special, but doing it in the cold mountain air, being so far away from what you can call ""civilization"", and with a backpack makes it interesting enough. [This is me on the 2nd pitch](https://imgur.com/lNZA6Ex), and [here's an interesting piece of slab](https://imgur.com/oR69hBv) that felt way harder than IV, but might not have been the original route. It was actually astounding how often I could not have afforded to fall, even when following on bolted belays. You live, you learn.

Eventually we top out at the last pitch, which is still around 50m below the summit. Only some light scrambling separates us from victory. I start out following Travis pretty closely to avoid choosing a wrong hold or foothold, but then decide to fall back a few meters to not have him pull a rock on me. That decision ends up saving my life about 30 seconds later when a 500kg boulder dislodges and falls down not 6 feet from where I am at the time. Travis says it was a freak accident. In my personal experience, it happens on 100% of all alpine climbs. Your mileage may vary. [Here's us at the top](https://imgur.com/dOUWaCK). Remember your helmets people!

Now we're done, right? Ah, shit, we're still on [top of a fucking mountain](https://imgur.com/5ogLzpo). And now we have to get down without any fucking rope. Great. Just what I needed after almost dying 5 minutes after I untied. The descent starts with a really [exposed ridge traverse](https://imgur.com/SjXuUEQ), which turns into a rather [muddy trail that winds down into the ravine](https://imgur.com/C0n6XQR). Honestly, that part of the climb was the most stressed out I've ever been in my life. I wasn't looking forward to making my way down [this again](https://imgur.com/pIYH7DJ), but at least that didn't feel like a single misstep would mean instant death. The approach was merely tiring, but the descent was horrifying. Here's Travis obviously being a lot better at [sliding down the side of a mountain in a controlled manner](https://imgur.com/8vYlfYl) than me.

Finally, time for a beer! [Here it is](https://imgur.com/e4URkWa), [there it goes](https://imgur.com/jvv4GU6), [aaaand it's gone](https://imgur.com/mRRx4qF). Can I relax now? Ah, fuck, still gotta get down to the car. Well, down is easier on the muscles, but harder on the knees. There's always a tradeoff. At least it's faster, and this time, I get to really appreciate [my surroundings](https://imgur.com/xdWWWnJ). Travis tells me the earliest point in time to get excited about survival is when you're in the car. [Am I good now?](https://imgur.com/8LfVWuX) I am actually too tired to get hyped up, and I am glad I don't have to drive both of us back. Travis keeps soldiering through it all as if this was just an afternoon stroll to him. As thankful as I am for him taking me along, I hate him for that.

So, what did I learn about alpine climbing? The most important takeaway is that alpine climbing is about a whole lot of things, but it is not predominantly about the actual climbing. The drive and approach take a lot of energy out of you, and you still need to not fall asleep at the wheel going home. Between those, there's lots of possibility for things to go south, some of them entirely outside your control. Like that fucking murderous piece of rock that almost made my wife a single mother. The worst part is that I can never tell her about it, or I will have to find another hobby. Apart from that episode, it was alot of fun, even the part where I learned that my endurance is not good enough for walking up a mountain for hours. Overall, I enjoy the climbing itself way more than the landscape, the approach or all the safety procedures and details. I think I'll stick to mostly single-pitch sport climbing for now, see if I get the urge to venture into the mountains again. I have the deepest respect for people who climb actually technically hard things in this setting, as well as all the other folks that a regular alpine climbers. It's a whole different animal than sport climbing and you need to respect that if you want to come back alive. I was glad I had Travis on my side to keep us both safe, thanks again buddy.",climbing,1531749784,individual_throwaway,0,1,True,2018-07-16
26,Total NEWB question - DWS in Greece?,"Hello everyone! 

I have been doing bouldering (with occasional top rope and even a couple of outdoor escapades) for \~ a year and a half now, and a friend of mine told me about Deep Water Soloing. And I immediately felt like I had to try it. A brief, 5 minute Google research (which included some posts here, too) has shown that apparently there are plenty of places in the Mediterranean to try this. Coincidentally, I've always wanted to go to Greece, and I think these two things would fit perfectly to make an amazing trip.

I'd like to know, first of all, from a purely theoretical perspective, what do I need to take into account when DWSing? Feel free to dumb it down as much as you want, but from what I understood is basically bouldering, where a body of water is your fall mat.

And, from a more practical perspective, if you have DWSed in Greece, where have you done it, what preparation did you need (i.e., rent a boat, hire a guide, rent equipment, etc), all those kinds of things.

Thanks a lot!

55,[Advice] Intercostal muscle strain... please chime in if you can.,"A little over six weeks ago I was climbing at my local gym and experienced an excruciatingly sharp pain... fast forward to today and I am pretty sure it's an intercostal muscle strain or possibly a tear.

When it happened I made sure to do the RICE treatment for a few weeks, and then I went to a general doctor. He said it was probably an intercostal muscle strain and sent me on my way with a seemingly useless dosage of some steroid to reduce inflammation... I wasn't very impressed with the attention I received. The next step I suppose would be getting an MRI, but that would be expensive and I don't want to get one if it's just overkill.

I have been climbing two times since then, and only did slab warm up problems. The strain doesn't hurt 95% of the time, but then I'll bend down or something and it'll tweak and hurt for a short while. Because of this I thought it best to play it safe and not try to climb much, if at all.

Have any of you had this injury (or something like it) in the past? How did you deal with it? Should I go get an MRI? Please help, I'm struggling to deal with the mental aspect of the situation.

85,new climber here,"hey guys, I've been bouldering for a few months and am just getting into top rope gym climbing and eventually would like to get into in and outdoor sport climbing. I've already got my chalk bag and shoes but I'm looking to buy my first harness, locking carabiner and belay device and I'm looking for some advice and suggestions. 

what is the most comfortable harness that you have worn that is useable for sport and top rope that won't break the bank? I can't afford any arcteryx gear. also do all harnesses destroy your scrote while hanging in them or are rentals particularly bad?

for carabiners what do you tend to prefer? I'm leaning towards an auto locking carabiner for convenience sake but I'm open to being convinced. 

lastly I can't afford a grigri and my gym won't allow me to use one anyways but I sort of prefer the ATC regardless. I'm looking at the black diamond one but just a couple questions about it. there's the version with the teeth that is supposed to apply more friction to the rope, does this actually help at all and will it wear down ropes faster? also is it worth the couple bucks extra over the standard version? which do you guys prefer?

45,Let's hear your climbing stories!,"Hello r/climbing! I worked in Yosemite Valley for half a year and was very quickly pulled into the unavoidable climbing culture. I always wanted to climb rocks, but never really took the time to learn much about it. I thought if I could climb poles using only upper body strength, I'll be a good climber. I asked my new roommate, Paul, a returning seasonal employee/climber, if he could help me pick out some climbing gear. He asked what my budget was, I told him I had around $500 and he had a pep in his step on our way to the mountain shop. With some brand new shoes, a harness, an ATC, a biner, and a chalk bag, we moseyed up the no longer maintained path to [Circuit Breaker](https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105979654/circuit-breaker) and set up a top rope on the 20' crack. Still not being adjusted to the elevation, I was light headed by the time we finished the approach. The mosquitos were out in full force, and they were a lot bigger than the mosquitos at home. Paul didn't seem to care (dude had a really hairy back, like, sasquatch level hairy). He taped up his fingers and scrambled up the side to anchor a tree for the top rope. I dug my fingers into the crack as hard as I could, managed to smear my way up about 4 feet, and fell, over and over until my arms gave out. My fingers were bleeding, I was physically drained, and I never sent circuit breaker. Defeated, I was put in my place. I had a lot of respect for the technique and dedication of climbers/boulderers after that.

17,Crimp grip and A2 injury,"I’ve recently had an A2 pulley injury, and have looked at the grip to better understand why it happened.  I climb mainly open handed but train the half crimp grip and never really crimp, but the hold I did it on was at such an angle that it almost forced my hand into a crimp.  This was after 9 tries or so, no pain before.

But what I’ve noticed about it is the angle of the proximal phalanx relative to the metacarpal.  All texts seem to describe the crimp grip as a hyperextension of the distal joints, but I’ve never seen is a description of the angle between the proximal phalanx and the metacarpal, which is also apparent in the crimp grip and not the open or half crimp grip.  

In fact, when I was doing finger glides for rehab, it was when that angle was in flexion that I felt any pain.  This makes me question whether the injury occurring during a crimp has more to do with the flexion of the mcp joint, rather than the hyperextension of the pip or dip joint.

The iron pins and rings, left over from quarrying up until the 60's, are as bomber as they come, and there is plenty of friction from breaking over that 90* edge, but I can't say I've ever seen a top rope setup quite like this, or that I've ever met someone who would rather thread a rope instead of slinging the old rungs.

My question is the screws the beast maker came with are so long, they extend almost two inches out of the board. If I used them they would go through the 3/4” plywood and into drywall. Is that how I’m supposed to mount? or should I measure and find screws that would extend exactly 3/4” into my plywood board.

29,Crack widths your cams will fit (tool),"I'm a beginning trad climber building a rack, and I made a tool for determining how many cams in my rack will fit into cracks of a given width. You can use it to determine whether your rack has holes in it, and what cams would fill those gaps.

The first page shows a graph of all available cams on the market. It's kind of interesting to see what all the companies provide the most coverage for.

The second page shows an example of what a full BD Cam rack looks like, since that's essentially the standard.

To edit the page for your racks, make a copy of the page and save it to your google drive. From there you can edit the tool as you wish.

Nuts, hexes, and tricams are not included.

32,Climbing in Denver,"Hey guys, I'll be in Denver at the end of the month for a few days and I want to do some climbing while I'm there.

35,Do trad climbers leave a lot of gear behind?,"Relatively new to climbing, only a few months in and haven't gotten outside yet, but making great progress leading indoors and consuming every iota of climbing media on earth and trying to learn everything about every discipline. I've probably watched a thousand videos on building anchors, rappelling, placing protection, etc. 

I tried a quick search in the post history here but didn't get a lot, so here's my question: I came across a video that was roughly titled ""How to abseil a multi pitch route"", and noticed from the setup that the climber placed a long length of accessory cord around a boulder at the top to create his anchor, and then threaded the rope through to abseil. When he got down to the next ledge where he could set up a new anchor, he pulled the rope through the cord at the top, built a new anchor with a few pieces of gear, got down to the bottom of the next pitch, pulled the rope through, etc....

So did he leave the accessory cord, some nuts, and any other gear used to build his anchors up on top of the rock and leave? It seems a little bizarre to me that climbing gear isn't exactly cheap, so leaving it all behind every time you go climb somewhere new would be not only expensive, but pretty much the opposite of ""leave no trace"". And to tangent off the LNT principle that climbers really seem to push (rightfully so), do adventure climbers leave gear and cords and stuff on top of first ascents or serene mountains that noone has ever climbed before? It would seem to be quite the opposite of LNT.

I was just hoping someone could explain to me whether this is common, whether it's the only way, or if there are other methods that don't involve leaving expensive gear on top of the rock that you can't get back. A side question as well, I thought you weren't supposed to thread rope through rope/runners/slings/cord, or that there should always be a carabiner between them? Is this not the case either? 

If it helps for determining common practices, I believe the climbing video I am referencing was shot somewhere in the UK. I also have no intention of starting a sport vs trad vs bouldering debate, as the question I'm asking is only really about trad, and I understand rapping or lowering off of fixed anchors/chains on a sport route. 

I'm not sure if this is against any rules, but this is the video I'm referring to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xddVyQUyJlE 
If you'd also like to point out anything wrong with the instruction as many did in the comments, be my guest! THANKS!",climbing,1530902371,tebahpla-backwards,18,1,True,2018-07-06

37,Is it a bad idea to switch the carabiners in a quickdraw?,"So my first set of quickdraws are sliver/orange and I started using them with the silver side clipping to rock. Unfortunately that's the side that was meant to be clipped to the rope (it has the rubber end in the dogbone to hold the carabiner more securely), and I dont want to just start using the opposite end since they're probably fairly scratched up and could damage the rope (plus I'd like to keep the colors the same). Is it safe to switch them? I assume so but I don't know if it could damage the rubber part of the dogbones. Thanks!",climbing,1530909026,wildergheight,8,1,True,2018-07-06

40,Why is it said that each generation of free climbers is better than the last?,"I get that the technology improves over time.  E.g. some new type of nanotech makes it possible to have a cam that can be placed in a tinier crack than ever before, or some new discovery in bionics breakthrough makes shoes more gecko-like.  So climbers can put more trust in their gear with each passing year, making it more comfortable to pull off moves that would be too strenuous or risky for climbers in the past with more primitive gear.

But the way people usually talk about it, it sounds like there are actually improvements in climbing technique itself as time passes.  The implication is that climbing's body of knowledge encompasses a more thorough understanding of musculature, conditioning, and the art of positioning one's body on a rock formation than in the past.  Is that true?  Are there moves that could be pulled off now that simply couldn't have been done in the 1980s (or whenever) but could be sent now, assuming that a climber in either era had done the same amount of dedicated training over the course of their lives and both were wearing the same gear--techniques that have been recently invented, for all intents and purposes?

1,La Sportiva Fit,"Just getting into the sport, doing mostly gym bouldering so far. I finally git my first shoe, Tarantulaces. When I bought them in person, the fit was fantastic (for a beginner shoe at least), but as many of you know they stretch like the dickens. After I noticed that my laces on every eyelet were almost, if not, touching and where the tongue was connected all scrunched, I decided to go for a different pair. While I was looking, I found the Finales for about the same price as the original pair.



I decided to get a full size down(44.5 down to a 43.5), assuming the leather would stretch in a similar fashion. My toes are feeling the size down, still doable but definitely tighter. The heel though feels less than snug, even ""burping"" while walking on flat ground. What's the deal here? Do I need to go back up to let my heel ""settle in,"" or is the shoe just not going to work?

29,Advice on Miura VS Sizing,"Hey all,

I recently got out of Yosemite with a pair of busted up TC Pros, which I had sized at 40. These were painful at first but I could wear them all day on multi-pitch by the time I got into the Valley. (I wear 41.5 street)

So, I figured that while I was waiting for those to get resoled, I would go ahead and get a pair of more aggressive Miura VS's because I will be doing a lot more sport, bouldering, and gym climbing now that I'm back in LA. I sized these at 40.5 because the 40's for the VS felt a little to gnarly all around. But, with the 40.5's I am able to wiggle my big toes a little bit though they are still nice and painful towards my outer toes. I do have really wide hobbit feet so that might be why these aggressive shoes feel a little weird.

Should I be worried about the Miuras stretching out to much and messing up performance? Am I being a baby about the shoes tightness?

Thanks!

30,One Year Climbing Anniversary. A few observations!,"One year ago I started climbing on a whim. Climbing has meant a lot to me over the last year, so I was feeling rather contemplative. I jotted down a few thoughts.   For what it is worth, here is part of what I wrote. I hope you enjoy.   

While I have primarily climbed indoors, my few forays into the outdoors were absolute blasts (despite being incredibly humbling). When I first started climbing, I could climb Vfun-, but now I am climbing Vfun+. Here are the 10 things I have learned in one year of climbing:

1.	Have fun!!! Climbing is fun…even when it isn’t. Learn to enjoy the process. 

2.	Fear is a normal experience. I was really embarrassed at how fearful I was when I first started bouldering. Ropes still scare me. I thought something was wrong with me. Turns out, a lot of people are scared. Realizing that many people struggle with fear normalized the experience and allowed me to work through it. Even now, when fear creeps in, I smile because I know it is an opportunity to work through it.

3.	Injuries suck! On a number of occasions, I have suffered small injuries that kept me out of climbing for 2-3 weeks. Fortunately, I have not suffered a major injury.  Listen to your body. There is no need to be a hero. It is ok to move on to a different problem. Quit your session early today, so you can climb tomorrow!

4.	Reddit is awesome! The bouldering and climbing subreddits have provided a wealth of tips and information. For every douchebag, there are 20 people who are helpful and encouraging. Thank you!

5.	Neil Gresham Master Class is your friend as a beginner. Watch. Practice. Rewatch and practice some more!

6.	Grades are confusing. On the same day in the gym, I flashed a V4 only to fail to a V1. Go visit a different gym, and all of sudden, you are climbing two grades higher than normal grade. Go visit Joshua Tree, and be humbled by V0’s…..repeatedly. Grades are all over the place. That’s ok! It’s part of the experience. In fact, discussing and debating grades with friends is rather fun! 

7.	Climbers are…really cool! I was shocked by how easy it was to make friends in the gym and at the crag. Like many beginners, I was especially nervous to climb next to an experienced climber. Surely they thought this gumby was the worst they’ve ever seen…but to receive encouragement, tips, and adulation was heart-warming and motivating. Many thanks to those who invested in my development as a beginning climber. Thank you to those who cheered me on when I struggled on the crux of the pink V2 in the corner. I know it was an easy problem to you, but it meant a lot that you were rooting for me.

8.	Invite your friends! Seems to me that a lot of people like climbing…they just don’t know it yet.

9.	Technique matters! Don’t get me wrong, without the proper strength, it can be hard to execute proper technique. This is especially true when you start out. Nevertheless, my gym seems to have two setters who are notorious for setting long, reachy, power moves. Even at 6 feet tall, the moves seemed impossible and involve way too much power for a scrub like me.  Too many times though, I watched someone smaller and weaker utilize wise or creative technique to send the problem. Lesson learned…stop complaining…time to get back to work!

10.	Have fun! Seriously! After about 6 months, my noob gains were over and I had plateaued!  Climbing was frustrating and stale. As I sat down, pondering if I should cancel my gym membership, a lady entered the gym, while pushing in a young man in a wheelchair. I do not know what he suffered from, but his symptoms were similar to someone with cerebral palsy. As part of the therapy, his therapist would lift him out of the chair, walk him to the wall, and he would grab the holds and traverse the wall, with his feet on the ground. Every move was a struggle. He shook violently. Without the therapist assisting him, he would not have been able to even stand himself against the wall. I was incredibly inspired. This man was giving it his all. I started climbing at the age of 32. I wish I started at 12….but here I am. I am not as strong or as healthy as I would like to be. Injuries over the years (specifically to shoulders and knees) have taken their toll. Despite all this, I am still able to climb. If V2 was going to be my limit, then so be it. I was going to have fun at whatever level I could climb. The ability to climb is a gift. Do not take it for granted…you may not have that ability tomorrow. Smile. Work hard. Have fun!

42,Use second rope as tag line or twin rope?,"I'm going for some multi-pitch climbing next week, and to be able to rappel full rope lengths I've got two ropes. The ropes are Beal Joker which are rated for both single, half and twin use. Also, they are distinctively different colors, red and blue. Since neither me or my climbing partner have any experience with half rope belaying my initial thought was that my partner would carry the second rope in her backpack. (I'll do all the leading.) Then I thought of the two alternatives that don't require any special belaying technique, using the second rope as a tag line or using both ropes as twins.

I can see a few pros and cons of each method.

Backpack:  
\+ No extra rope management during the climb  
\- Need to get rope out of backpack at the top and flake it to prepare for rappel.  
\- More weight for my partner, who is not quite as strong as I am, to carry.  
\- In an emergency where I could use the second rope, it's down with my partner.

Tag line:  
\+ No extra rope management during the climb  
\+ I have one end of the second rope at all times  
\+ Less weight for my partner  
\- Progressively more weight for me as I ascend  
\- Tiny but maybe real risk of clipping the wrong rope?  
\- Risk that the tag rope gets stuck?

Twin rope:  
\+ I have one end of the second rope at all times  
\+ Less weight for my partner  
\+ Safer since there is no risk at all of clipping the wrong rope  
\+ Safer because it's two ropes  
\- Progressively more weight for me as I ascend  
\- Rope management when belaying

Like I wrote above, we don't have half rope experience so I don't consider that an option for now, but I'm thinking twin rope could be manageable.

11,Is this technique to back off a route with less fall distance used much?,"I read [a doc from Petzl](https://web.archive.org/web/20120311135917/http://www.petzl.com/files/all/en/activities/sport/Solutions-Sport-climbing_Catalog-2011.pdf) where to back off a route (single pitch sport) they suggest replacing quick draws with quick links and using a prussik between the leader harness and wall side of the rope to limit fall distance if the top bolt blows. I guess the scenario is you run into a runout section and the saving grace bolt is sketch or there's bad choss above so you need to lower.

The quick link suggestion is interesting. Quick draws are &gt;$13 and a quick link is ~$4. But in the face of a sketchy bolt, I'm not sure how much I would care about that price difference. Situational I guess, but it's a lot of effort, potentially pumpy effort.

What I'm really curious about is the prussik to reduce distance fallen on the lead rope. Does this have a name? Has anyone done this, is it taught? They say they tested a 4m fall of 80kg on 7mm prussik and 9.7mm rope, both ropes ""in tact"" and ""fall arrested"". They don't say how much rope was out or other parameters that could affect how it performs. Would falling on this system with some altered parameters could lead to severe or catastrophic damage? I guess worth trying if you find yourself in such a situation where the top bolt is extremely untrustworthy and would lead to a ground fall if it blew. Are there any other gotchas about this system?

I'm also curious if that prussik scenario could be useful in trad and multipitch. Using it would always be highly situational, but I don't see why it wouldn't be applicable in trad or multipitch.",climbing,1530502372,lakechfoma,25,1,True,2018-07-01

Mostly looking for any suggestions for the following stuff:

\- Which areas to focus on? If there's a place to set up a base and go climb from there, that would be excellent.

\- Getting around. Flying into Paris, would we just need a car? Is there any other way to go about this?

\- Good suggestions on places to stay. The cheaper the better, but probably will actually want a room as opposed to camping (hostels?)

\- Drag my pads all the way from Canada ($$$$$), or somewhere nearby to rent?

26,PSA: waterknots and other knots in slings,"There was a discussion about failure modes on (water knots in slings)[https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/8usqw0/do_not_tie_your_slings_with_waterknots_deutscher/] .

The whole thread was, frankly, scary, because there were a few (very!) dangerous (and upvoted!!) suggestions. I did comment on one of them, but it will be buried since the thread is already 18 hours old. I would like to clarify and summarize possible ways of joining slings.

NOTE: Some people in the original thread were mixing up slings and chords/ropes. It is important to treat both seperately. In this thread, i am talking about slings (flat webbing). Nothing i say is applicable to ropes and chords. There are many knots to join ropes that are safe. There are only two knots that may be used to join slings.

1) water knot:
The advantage of the water knot is that it can be tied with one hand. The disadvantage is that the water knot can fail when caught on a spike. This is not very likely, but there have indeed been fatalities due to this failure mode. You will be fine if you know about the failure mode, tighten it, dress it properly, and ensure that the knot is hanging in the air. 
Still, this is not ideal So what are the alternatives to the waterknot?

2) Sewn slings. Replace most of your slings with sewn slings slings. It goes without saying that sewn slings don't have this failure mode, so you should use them whenever possible. Still, unsewn slings can be more flexible in some situations,  so don't throw them out! it does make  sense to carry a few.

3) rethreaded figure of eight:
This is the alternative suggested by most people. It does not have the same failure mode as the water knot as far as i know. Still, It is probably a good idea to make sure that the knot is tightened and free-hanging.

4) Using any other knot to join slings (including the edk!!):  
Some people have been suggesting using an edk to join slings.
Do not use any knot except waterknot or rethreaded figure of eight(like waterknot but starting with a figure of eight instead of overhand) to join slings. Note that im talking about slings (flat material): The knots usually used to join chords and ropes work differently when in flat material! It is safe to joint two ropes or chords wiht an edk, it is not safe to join two slings.
DO NOT JOIN FLAT WEBBING/SLINGS WITH AN EDK (OR ANY OTHER KNOT). THEY WILL FAIL EVEN UNDER LOW LOAD.

5) two edk's:
Some people suggest this, it may be safe, but no tests on this have been carried out. You are on your own.


Takeaway: The original thread was a warning about the water knot. However, the alternatives that have been suggested are far more dangerous than the waterknot. So: whenever possible, use sewn slings. If you must use unsewn slings, join them with a rethreaded fig. of eight. If you must tie them with one hand, use the water knot, and make sure it is free hanging, well dressed and tightened.

NEVER use any other knots to join slings. ",climbing,1530345748,leesinfreewin,35,1,True,2018-06-30

Does anyone have any designs or ideas on how to hang it or create a mount to hang from? I want it to hang a few feet away so I can climb vertical without touching the tree.

61,Pain on Dorsal Side of DIP Joint when Crimping,"Hello,

As the title states, whenever I crimp (half or full), I feel pain on the dorsal (top/back/non palmside) side of my left middle finger DIP joint (top knuckle). I'm planning to go see a doctor to get a referral to PT or a hand specialist, but I couldn't get an appointment before my July 4 climbing trip. So hopefully someone who's had similar injury can share their experiences.

First, open hand gripping elicits no pain at all. For crimping, I've slowly stressed it more and more via hangboard (I like the hangboard as a rehab tool) and am fairly sure I haven't lost any strength. Whenever I hop off the wall or hangboard, the pain goes away in at most 2 seconds. I've tried immediately massaging (with both hand and graston) and don't feel pain in any other part of the finger (notably the pulley areas) but just the sides and top of the joint.

Any advice?",climbing,1530458728,HolyCarppp,4,1,True,2018-07-01

Google Translated
&gt;The elite climber Adam Ondra wants to win the MS in climbing for the third time in Innsbruck, Austria, then goes to Yosemit where he wants to climb his way to the famous El Capitan style on-sight - he came, saw, climbed. At the same time, he has to think about the Olympics and gradually get involved in the preparation of unpopular climbing speed. He described his training in an interview with 

&gt;Radiožurnál.
I do not know, but El Capitan has never climbed the on-sight style, paving the way for the first attempt without any information. I have a chosen path named Salathé and I would like to try the first on-sight of El Capitana. It should be this fall in November.

&gt;And how many days would you like to manage (The Dawn Wall journey lasted 8 days, note red) ? I'd like to do it for 12 hours (laughs) . There are different paths of different difficulty on El Capitan. The lighter ones can be dealt with in 12 hours. Even freely, that is, we use fuse only for protection. Those harder, like Dawn Wall, last for seven or 17 days. The heaviest lengths are the difficulty 8b. It does not sound so hard, but it can climb after 10 hours of climbing ... Moreover, I have one try. 

On sighting El Cap is a pretty huge goal to talk up, but if anybody can, its Ondra right?

Some other interesting quotes on the Olympics and the combined sport, bouldering and speed disciplines:

&gt;I'm still against it, but I know I can not do anything about it, it's decided. The climbing federation itself can no longer withdraw from it. I wondered for a while, but in the end I decided it would be a shame not to participate in the Olympics. For a long time, I decided if I was going to train, but I'm not decided yet. I will try it a few times, of course

.

&gt;I tried it, but at the first attempt, one does not have time to publish. The percentage of training that will go on speed will be between five and ten percent of my total volume in 2019.

I'm glad he plans on participating.  I don't know if he's still a favorite for any competition climbing like he once was.  Seems like it has diverged from outdoor climbing more than when he was last really dedicated to competition and winning World championships in boulder and lead.

23,Strange wrist locking/popping on slopers,"FTP on mobile. Sorry for any grammar/spelling errors. Sorry if this is the wrong sub. 

I’ve been having an issue with my wrist, occasionally, that I haven’t been able to find anything out about online. 

Rarely, when I’m climbing a sloper problem, my left wrist locks up so that it can’t bend more than ~20 degrees. My fingers still have full range of motion, but for whatever reason, my wrist can’t bend any further until I completely relax that hand, which isn’t always an option on the wall. It feels as if the tendon is catching on something in my wrist. Like it’s trying to round a corner or something. 

If I pull harder to try to wiggle it through, I have to get my fingers to right angle and I hear a popping noise as it finally snaps into place, restoring my full range of motion. Unfortunately it tends to leave my wrist feeling stiff for a couple days afterwards. It seems to have specific angles, as certain sloper problems frequently cause it, while others never do. And my fingers are fully engaged every time. 

Anyone have any idea what’s going on? I’ve gathered that I should not push through, but is there any way to prevent it?",climbing,1530194890,paradox037,11,1,True,2018-06-28

For starters, Ive been to the doctor's office and a physical therapist and nothing really seems to be helping, hence looking for online suggestions. But for those who are going to suggest a doctor (as they absolutely and rightfully should!), Im way ahead of ya!

It started early May. Climbed pretty hard - tried to climb without breaks on easier climbs and then ended with a VERY difficult climb. Felt normal tiredness. 3 hours later my arm is incredibly sore and Im having trouble bending it. I assume its just extra soreness and itll pass. It doesnt pass and it's been plaguing me ever since. 

My PT thinks its a bicep tendon strain but he's not totally sure - and the sessions are pretty much just him rubbing my forearm for 10 minutes at 25$ a pop. 

It hurts to rotate my arm, it feels swollen when I fully bend my arm in, and the upper forearm just generally feels very tight, especially when I rotate it outward. I havent climb since and its been KILLING me - in all honesty, climbing was very much a mentally therapeutic activity and it's been incredibly depressing to stop. Im here because Im hoping someone else has experienced this and can either definitely say Im fucked or suggest some sort of training regimen to help heal. Either way, Im up for any suggestions!

31,Is it normal for a climbing rope to be slightly softer in some places and slightly harder in others?,"I have a Mammut Eternity and it’s pretty new. I’ve used it for a week of climbing outdoors in Malta and and overall probably 10 indoor sessions. 

It’s sustained one big-ish fall inside (max factor 0.3) but otherwise nothing serious.

I’ve kept it in good conditions; always on a tarp when I’m use and in a rope bag in storage except directly after use where I leave it to “dry” on the back of a chair (even though it never sustained any noticeable dampness). It’s never had any contact with any dodgy chemicals and hasn’t been left in the sun. It also has no visible damage on the outside and I think most people looking at it would think it basically looks new.

I’m probably just being overly paranoid but when I run my fingers along it I notice that some bits are ever so slightly harder than others. Nothing major (like you can’t properly bend the rope in the soft bits and the hard bits aren’t super bunched) but it’s enough to make me wonder...

What are people’s thoughts? Is this just one of those things where no rope can have a perfectly consistent core all the way through?

1,[Relationships] My GF doesn't like my climbing partner. Should I have a frank conversation with her about my relationship with climbing/my climbing partner? Or would that make things worse?,"\[tl;dr\] Should I have a frank conversation with my partner about my relationship with climbing/ my climbing partner? Or should I leave it and not open a potential can of worms, when the situation might become better in time?  


I was wondering if anyone would be able to offer me their take on my situation, which I'm sure is common in the climbing world and other partner-based hobbies.

My primary climbing partner is female. She's a few years younger than me, and we're both currently in separate relationships. There's a vibe as she's attractive, we share the same passion, short-term goals etc. but nothing either of us are interested in pursuing.

Naturally, we climb together 2-4 times per week in the gym, go on weekend trips to climb and go take vacations to climb too.

Before every trip I find myself in a bit of turmoil about how exactly to explain my plans to my partner. She doesn't love that fact that I spend loads of time with my climbing partner, and enjoys me spending weekends/vacations climbing with her even less.

This is obviously understandable. A previous relationship of my own was with a girl who danced competitively, almost exclusively, with a guy who literally looked young David Beckham. They danced well together. He was a good guy. Nothing bad ever happened. I didn't love the fact that it was with another guy, but I loved that she could fly off to and pursue her passion. But how I felt in that situation is largely besides the point.

In my mind there are likely a few obvious reasons why she doesn't love me climbing with my climbing partner:

1. I spend a lot of time and money on climbing
2. I spend a lot of time with my climbing partner
3. I'm often super hyped about the time/money/climbs I do with my climbing partner
4. Naturally, often my climbing partner spend nights in a room/tent together
5. She doesn't really like my climbing partner full-stop. They've met a few times, but they clearly don't really like each other. They're extremely different people. 
6. The fact my climbing partner is a woman makes this 100x worse, as she understandably thinks that on some level it's possible something COULD happen (although it absolutely will not)

My current view on the situation is: I love my passion and I obviously also love my partner. I think it's reasonable to love both. The point of contention is that I think that it's okay (but obviously not idea) that currently my love for my passion involves my climbing partner. For me the two are separate. 

I've been wanting to have a frank chat with my partner about the way she feels, as we haven't explicitly talked about it. 

Do you think it would be a good idea to talk to her to:

1. Explain how I feel about me loving climbing, and that being separate from who I climb with. 
2. Emphasize that that's nothing specifically to do with climbing with my climbing partner - I have equally great experiences with my other climbing friends (although far less frequently).
3. Reassure her that there is nothing romantic between me and my climbing partner 

Or do you reckon this would just open an un-closable can of worms regarding my relationship with my climbing partner that put a stark: climbing/climbing partner vs gf into my relationship? My current hope is that I'll find another regular climbing partner/group, so my partner won't have to deal with me telling her I'm going away for another week in Europe to climb, much less with a woman she doesn't even like?

A sanity check would be much appreciated, as I know I can often think myself into a...less than reasonable position.",climbing,1529957048,nothanksxxxxxxx,1,1,True,2018-06-25

I have had some top-roping classes to get some proper instruction on belaying and top-rope climbing and have top-roped/belayed both on real rock and routinely indoors for the past three months or so (hardest grades: indoor 6b+, outdoors 6a).

I now want to start lead climbing and I am going on a climbing trip to Kalymnos (in Greece), and was looking for recommendations for a first rope! From the research I've done so far it looks like the edelrid python is a good choice as it comes in 70m length which should be more than enough, and the 10mm thickness feel like it's going to take a few falls safely! 

Any suggestions as to what ropes you guys started out with and things to look out will be much appreciated! I live in the UK and my budget is between the £120-£140 range!

29,Does rope burn on my brake hand mean I am not belaying correctly?,"TL;DR I just started learning to belay someone on a top rope (not lead climbing) and the friction from the rope sliding through my brake hand as I choke up or slide up the rope toward the ATC is causing rope burns. Is this a sign I am using improper technique? 

I am a very new climber - about a month in - so please excuse my ignorance if I use a term incorrectly or something. I try to do as much research as possible, watch videos, practice, ask questions, and so forth, and I took a class on belaying before attempting to belay anyone, but I am a little unsure on my technique because I do feel like I am taking up slack either very frequently or too much slack in any given pull because as I slide my brake hand up after braking and putting my left hand under my brake hand, I seem to be burning myself. I don't think that I was bitten by the ATC because I try to concentrate on stopping my brake hand 6 inches or more away from the device. I have done a lot of Googling, as aside from the existence of belay gloves, I don't see any evidence that people burning themselves as they belay when they are not catching a fall or letting someone down too fast. I worry that my technique is not good because I certainly want to be the best and safest partner I can be. I have caught a couple falls from the climber slipping, and they did not fall any distance and I had no issues catching them and braking, but I am still concerned. Is this at all normal?

16,Story of how injured my shoulder (SLAP) and I'm finally back on the wall. [LONG],"I'm writing this because I had a very typical injury among climbers and it seems like I'm finally over it. So this just in case my experience could be helpful for somebody.

Note: I'M NOT A DOCTOR THIS IS JUST MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT KEEP IN MIND I'M NOT A PROFESIONAL

  
**Background**: 26 years old male climber.  I started climbing three years ago, and I started taking it a bit seriously around two years ago. I'm more a technical climber than a physical one. My top was redpoint 7a+ or 5.11d, and onsight 6c+ or 5.11d. I used to climb 3 - 5 days per week. 

Right before the shoulder injury my level was a bit lower because I was going back from a finger injury (A2 pulley, typical too right?) that took me out from climbing for a month. Another month after I came back from it, I started feeling some pain on my left shoulder so I stopped climbing soon.

**The injury, symptoms and diagnosis**. I actually don't remember how was it. It was not traumatic, like a failing or something, but I suspect that doing pull ups and campus was involved. It started being something annoying on my shoulder and it ended up with dull pain\*, feeling instability, lack of strength and lot of smalls cracking.

Pain was some kind of random, I couldn't sleep on the injured side, but it usually it was not painful by just doing one movement. For example, it was very uncomfortable while climbing and it felt painful while belaying or while cycling. If any, [this was the most painful movement I could do](https://i2.wp.com/tumejorfisico.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Sin-nombre7.png?resize=169%2C259&amp;ssl=1).

[What is a labrum?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenoid_labrum) It's something a bit similar to a meniscus but in our shoulders.

The diagnosis took some time and by the time doctors finally found out that the injury was on the labrum, I had already stopped all climbing activity a month earlier and resting hadn't done any better. 

**\***Dull pain means a kind of pain in which you can't identify where does it come from. (deaf pain)

**Treatment**: I had two options: surgery or rehab, and I took the second:

Surgery takes some risks, needs a longer recovery time (one year minimum), and the success percentage it's not a 100&amp;#37; guaranteed so I went to rehab as my first option, knowing that if it didn't succeed I could take a surgery later anyway.

The idea of the rehab was to build muscles and strength to hold the joint in its place, because the labrum it's very hard to regenerate but itself. Actually, in most cases, it never happens, so the idea is to have enough muscles to substitute it. Surgery basically sews it back so usually as a result you may experience mobility loss, and those stitches may break eventually too (It would be very unfortunate but it may happen). Obviously, after the surgery, rehab it's necessary too!

So rehab involved different exercises with weights (not much 2.5kg), balls and elastic bands for strengthening my shoulder and improving my proprioception. I had lot discipline about it, I visited my physiotherapist once every two weeks and I had those exercises to do at my place twice per day. I used 90 - 120 minutes each day just on them.

**Results**: I took rehab very seriously and finally, after 6 months I'm climbing again.

I don't feel any pain and my shoulder feels really strong. Rarely I still feel something wrong in there, but it's not anything that holds me down from doing any exercise and I think it's something on my mind more than any real trouble, anyways, I'm very careful with what I'm doing.

I have to keep doing exercises for my shoulders. I'm putting some time on training and getting really fit!

I can still onsight 6b+ so I'm very happy. However, I'm aware that this injury it's still going on so maybe in a couple of years, or maybe 5, or 10 I'll have to go to the surgeon.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
So the key for my (kind of quick) recovery was:

**Discipline**: I did all the rehab I had to do when I had to do it, even if I was busy, unmotivated, tired, or bored, I still did it. Twice per day, everyday.

**Try not to get depressed:** At first I though I may not climb again. When all your life goes around climbing, your friends are climbers, and your job it's connected with it, this kind of injures are very scary. The first doctor I saw told me I may never get back to climbing (Fuck you if you read this!).  
So it was a very hard time for me and it was very difficult not to feel unmotivated. I started doing some trail running, because I love being nature and being outdoors. It was not climbing, but made me focus and kept me happy.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
The reason of the injury was:

Not having enough strength. I was weak after a month with no climbing because of that finger injure and I came back like if it had never happened. Be careful when you get back from an injury guys!

Don't feel any hurry about being a better climbers. Enjoy climbing, those months were really awful for me!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For the **future**:

After several months, I'm feeling weak (my dynos are ridiculous), so I can't do the grade I was doing before. However being weak is forcing me to improve my technical skills, so I'm pretty confident that by the time I'm as strong as I was before the injure, plus my better technique will make a me a better climber. (if I don't injure myself again lol) Anyway, just being able to climb makes me happy.  
As I already said, I'm putting some attention on working out, and I keep doing exercises for my shoulders, as this injury it's going to be with me forever.

18,Finger Bruising?,"I was bouldering yesterday, and a few minutes after working a crimpy problem I noticed my ring finger felt odd, a bit like a lump in my fingertip (no lump though when using the other hand to check), and a bit tender between fingertip and the joint below.

Today it feels fine, no pain or weird feeling, just really bruised and possibly a tiny swollen. No pain if I cautiously open or full crimp my door frames.

24,What to do after a big climbing mistake?,"Yesterday, I made the biggest mistake of my short climbing career, and I would appreciate some help processing it. I was rappelling at the end of the day from a multipitch route, and the second to last anchor was on a somewhat large ledge, that was easy to stand on. I think because I felt so secure, I forgot to clip into the chains before going off rappel. I then did some rope management like feeding one end through the ring, tying a stopper knot, and coiling the the rope a little, and waiting for my partner. When he got to the bottom, he immediately noticed that I wasn’t clipped in, and said so. I, then had probably the biggest Oh Shit moment of my life/and immediately clipped it. While I had felt secure, the ledge was very exposed and sloping downward, and any loss of balance would have probably killed me. If I were a cat, I would definitely have one less life now.

I consider myself someone who cares about safety, and I try to do everything “by the book”. I have taken many classes (including a multipitch class w/ rappeling etc), read books, and sought out mentorship of more experienced climbers. I always rappel with a backup and tie end knots. On the other hand, I have done far more single pitch than MP rapping, so I guess it makes sense that I was in single pitch mindset when I got to that big ledge with a tree. Basically, I think my comfort level has passed my experience level. Also, because I was climbing with my more experience partner, I think I was more focused on things like rope management and not being a pain in the butt than I should have been. Otherwise, I think I have been too motivated by my ambitions of pushing grades, getting into multi-pitch, and ultimately alpine climbing, so I plan to just take a step back and focus on safety and having a good time. 

Apart from that little bit of introspection, I honestly don’t know how I should react to this mistake. I love climbing, but I am concerned that I lack some sort of crucial judgment ability that will be tested more and more thoroughly as I progress through the sport. What do you all think? If you had any “oh shit” moments, how did you react?",climbing,1529861407,Embarrased_Newb,105,1,True,2018-06-24

36,Kong Slyde,"Hey fellas, thanks for the constructive advice on how to and how not to use this thing. I spent some time yesterday playing with the Slyde to get a good feel of how it works and what it's limitations are.

It blocks all the cord diameters I have (3, 6, 8 &amp; 10.2mm) when properly oriented. Cord diameters less than 8mm do not block reliably and should not be used. The 10.2mm dynamic climbing rope blocks well but does not adjust easily like the smaller diameter cords.

It *does not* block when the device is rotated ~90* (in either direction) about the carabiner it's hanging from and will allow the cord to run freely to the stopper knot or where it is attached to the harness. ***From my perspective* it is not safe to use with accessory cord; it must be used with a dynamic rope.** 

This is vaguely described in the manufacturer's instructions:

https://www.kong.it/downloads/KONG_GENERAL_INFO.pdf

""E) **The anchoring position is essential for safely stopping a fall** : carefully assess the free height
under the user (clearance), height of a potential fall, rope paid out, the stretch in any energy
dissipaters or absorbers, the height of the user and the “pendulum” effect in order to avoid
all possible problems (e.g. ground, material rubbing against the rock face, abrasions, etc..).""

Through testing, it's possible for the plate to become wedged against the rock in a manner that allows the cord to come un blocked and run to one of its ends. The 8mm cord is rated to 14kN so it's not going to break but I'm not interested in taking a fall on static line. A fall on a such a short length of dynamic rope probably isn't pleasant either, can anyone provide insight on what kind of forces are at play taking a fall on such a short piece of dynamic rope?


Other thoughts:

The construction of this plate is a mystery. There is very little information about the use of this product from the manufacturer (Kong, Italy). Companies that describe their protective equipment as ""high quality"" don't lend much confidence to the consumer. 

The manufacturer's website says the plate is rated to 25kN. It is **NOT** CE or UIAA certified. The markings on the plate are: ""KONG"", ""BREV"" and ""KG. 2500"". Assuming ""KG. 2500"" is a reference to its strength, it's roughly 25kN but I'm not sure how well mass translates to falling force.

37,Stiff shoe to soft shoe pain,"I recently purchased the softest pair of shoes I've owned or even climbed in; mundakas. Before that the softest aggressive shoe I used was the narrow acros which I wore for a couple of years, but I have mostly climbed in stiffer shoes (shamans, arrowheads, zeros, redlines, etc). After only a short gym session and a couple of outdoor problems I had debilitating toe pain in the last joint in my right big toe with swelling in the outside of the joint the following day. These aren't the tightest shoes I've worn, or the narrowest, and I didn't kick the wall or stub my toe in any way.  


Has anyone else experienced something like this, is it normal to happen to someone with weaker toes, or is this just a case of a shoe really not fitting my foot? Sharing any experience switching from stiff to soft shoes would be welcome.",climbing,1529896917,traildigger15,7,1,True,2018-06-24

I climb up to v4, but always very messily, in that it takes me many many many tries to work out the sequence. It's not that I'm a bad climber when it comes to technique, with bent arms and pulling too hard etc. it's more that when looking at a problem I struggle to read the moves correctly and to put them into practice - individual moves are totally sweet, but linking them is my issue (part of the reason I don't TR or lead much) 

Watching world cups, I see the pros move their hands about like their mentally jotting down the moves, but when I try I always find that I can't quite execute my plans, and end up improvising.

I'm looking for some useful tips on how to handle double/twin ropes, especially on the belays.     
    
Last time I used them we were in a party of three. Although I tried to run nice loops over my tether that got smaller with each loop it always turned into a clusterfuck when we flipped the stack before I led the next pitch.     
One reason was also that the two ropes had an offset of a few meters because my followers were following with a bit of a distance in between.    
    
After a few pitches it was such a mess that we pulled the rope through which turned into a nice braid since apparently my followers were climbing around each other a few times.    
     
Therefore I'm really looking forward for your tips on how to optimize the system.

35,Wild Country Revo first impressions,"I got to play with a wild country revo earlier this week. Like all devices, especially ones with assisted braking, this device has a learning curve. My overall impression is that the assisted braking features are to be used as a backup and not a sidekick. This came as a surprise because almost all the other devices use their assisted braking features as a sidekick. For example: the GRIGRI, Click-up, MegaJul, Pilot, and other devices make it so that when you pull down on the brake strand to arrest a fall, the assisted braking feature engages. With the REVO, when you pull down on the brake strand you stop the assisted braking feature from ever engaging. If the assisted braking feature is already engaged, pulling down on the brake strand will then disengage it. Once you can get used to that paradigm shift, it's okay.

So Id like some advice for how to approach from here. It doesn't seem too bad, I can't put my full weight on it but I can walk (albeit with a limp). I reckon once it starts feeling ok I'm going to go back to top roping while hopefully pushing my buddy to keep leading.

I worry that I might flip out of my harness.  Etc. Etc.  While I can usually talk myself through/out of that mental pattern, but worry like that obviously impacts my performance.  Nothing traumatic has happened to me or around me when I've been climbing, so there's nothing that's driving the fear except my own tendency to catastrophize.  Anyone else have this sort of problem?

So yesterday I was climbing and using my shoulder/back in a strenuous position when all of a sudden I heard 2 or 3 loud ""cracks/pops"" in my skull and felt immediate pain/shock. I let go of the wall and felt a sort of numbness in my shoulder with some acute pain. By the time I was lowered back to the ground and untied my shoulder felt pretty fine. I reached all the way above my head and across my body with just a small twinge of pain - like a soreness after working out. An orthopedic surgeon who was on the trip said it could be a torn labrum and I thought that the injury might feel worse with time so I stopped climbing and went home.

Today, however, my shoulder still feels ok. I feel a sort of ""looseness"" in a muscle right below my shoulder blade and, while I have complete ROM, I feel a slight tightness when my arm moves in certain directions. The best way I can relate my feeling is that it feels like a minor ankle sprain that's a week into healing in my shoulder.
Since the symptoms feel so mild I doubt this is a torn labrum and if it wasn't for the extreme noise my shoulder had made I would chalk this up to ""soreness"" and not think about it. I want to work out my legs today and am supposed to be climbing again Thursday - I'm wondering if I should just treat what happened in my shoulder as just general ""soreness"" and give it rest until Thursday but otherwise continue lifting weights or if I should just take off a week or two and consider it to be a more serious issue.

I was kinda scared at first because of all those buff climbers that are all much more skilled than me. After buying my shoes I went in and struggled alot.

My biggest problem is strength. I'm male and I'm weak. Like SUPER WEAK. That was a big problem. I really need to gain strength fast, otherwise I can't even do the easy intermediate problems :/ Any tips for that?
Also my feet hurt like hell. Specifically my big toe. That's why I had to leave kinda early because I couldn't walk anymore, let alone put any pressure on my big toes. I know the shoes will widen but I always assumed they are not supposed to hurt that much. The guy who was selling me the shoes was still confident that that was the right size for me.

There weren’t many responses at the time, but I still get a couple messages a year from people with the same issue asking if I figured out the cause. 

I’m sorry to report the answer is no. It just went away on its own after a while. Never saw a doctor about it. 

I’m updating because I recently started experiencing this sensation again, but this time on my left foot at the base of the 3rd and 4th toes. 

A few things worth noting... I’m always barefoot at home, and otherwise almost always in flip flops. I have Morton’s toes, plus kinda long toes in general. I have very high arches, so while barefoot have a tendency to supinate (walk with my soles turned slightly inward instead of flat, so weight is on the outer edges of my feet). This stuck-tape sensation is never accompanied by pain. I (sadly) only climb a couple times a month these days, and wear Evolv Elektras in just the right size; snug but not too tight. 

If you’ve experienced this stuck-tape sensation too, whats your day to day footwear situation like? Do you also go barefoot a lot? Supinate? Have high arches?

37,Advice for improving as a long-time beginner/maybe intermediate with abnormally short arms?,"So I’ve been climbing on and off for about 4-5 years now. I’ve gone outdoors a bit, but mostly stick indoors. Lately, I’m averaging a climbing sesh 2-3x a week. For about a year now, I’ve seen myself plateau around projecting and succeeding on maybe 70% of V4’s, and only getting a V5 if it caters to my strengths (crimps or endurance-based roof/overhangs). My biggest weakness is definitely my reach (my arm span is 58” aka 147cm... yes this is shorter than the reach of many teenagers/tall kids lol).  

I’ve used the search bar a bit regarding hangboarding to improve finger strength, with general recommendations saying for beginners to wait until V6 before starting this, but am I still really a beginner if I’ve been climbing for years and still just can’t get past the V5 threshold? 

I also feel like I should be improving on my weaknesses - slopers (I have so little surface area on my hands...  wrist crease to tip of middle finger is 6” aka about 15cm) and dynos (which I need to do on pretty much any route tbh). 

Would love any advice on where to go from here, whether it means just climbing longer and more frequently or specific ways I can start training to improve, whether in overall strength or in ways to work on what I’m worst at.  

I could also probably buy more aggressive shoes? Maybe? Am I at that point yet? No lie, I’m still rocking my beginner Elektra’s from 4-5 years ago.

I take about 800mg of Ibuprofen and then I can get back to sleep.  The next day, the pain will continue periodically. Usually it's gone by the day after that, but if I go to my gym again within about 5 days it'll flare up again basically the instant I start climbing.

Oddly the burning sensation won't actually be present as I climb, just when I get off the wall and rest between climbs.

1) Do the routes have chains at the top, or are we wrapping around a tree?

and

2) Can you reach the top by just having webbing and leaning over the side, or do you need to rappel down to the correct level for too many of them for us to make a weekend of it?

47,Does lotion hurt hands long term?,"So our climbing place just opened a new bouldering facility with a lot of cool cave and super overhung routes. This along with the fact that the holds are brand new (2 days old) and feel pretty much like sandpaper means that my hands are raw and blistered after not a super heavy amount of climbing. I’ve been climbing for a little over a year and usually when they get bad I just put some lotion on for a few days. In your experience, do you find that this softens your hands and just makes you keep getting the same raw hands or do you think this doesn’t happen and lotion is worth it especially for the quick recovery. I hope my hands eventually get tough and leathery enough to take more of a beating but I’m not sure if lotion is hindering this process by moisturizing a lot. Sorry if this sounds dumb I just want what’s best long term.

48,Weird finger issue,"I noticed a weird issue with my middle finger 2 weeks ago. I didn’t noticeably hurt it while climbing but one day it started feeling different.

There is no pain in my finger and I have climbed on it once since it started feeling weird but I didn’t experience any pain.  The only time I feel pain is if I try to crack the finger. When trying to crack, I feel a lot pressure and pain on the distal interphalangeal joint of the finger and I can’t go through with the crack. Oddly, I can crack my finger if I pull it to side vs cracking head-on as normal. 

Something is weird going on and I’m not sure what to do. I’ve rested for the last 2 weeks besides the one time climbing (and nothing hurt). I visited a dr. And they said it was a sprain so I taped for 1 week (no climbing), per their suggestion, but it didn’t do anything beneficial.

For the first time, I'm trying some crack routes at my gym, and while I think I've figured out how to effectively jam my fingers, fists, and arms in them for leverage when there's no nearby handholds, I'm still a bit antsy about reaching deep inside them. I tried to research my concerns online, but couldn't find much ([but not nothing](https://rockandice.com/climbing-accidents/climber-loses-finger-tips-in-crack/)). Isn't it a bit of a hazard, that if one falls (or accidentally cuts loose) while a knuckle, wrist, or elbow is locked in between a crack, it could easily result in a dislocation or worse?

27,Being spiked by a heavier belayer,"Posting on a separate account. This is something I've been wondering about for a while. 

I've been climbing for 2 years, leading for 1.5. One of my regular partners is more than 1.5x my weight (180 lbs to my 115). Me belaying him gets interesting, but in most cases we've found workarounds.

Him belaying me is an entirely different issue. 3 times now he's caught me so hard that I injured my ankle when slamming back into the wall, spraining it badly and in one instance tearing it. As each injury happens the chance of re-injury goes up (though I've seen doctors, rested the recommended time after each injury, and have been through extensive physical therapy).

He's an experienced climber and I've learned a lot from him, but he's never belayed someone as light as me before. He jumps when catching me, but from what I understand the timing of that jump can be difficult to get exactly right, and it seems like our weight difference only allows for a small margin of error. 

It's in my head now when I'm leading. Even though he's caught me countless times perfectly well, in the middle of a sketchy move I find myself questioning whether the fall is going to be bad again. It's keeping me from climbing as hard as I'd like to.

I've never belayed someone lighter than me, so I don't know what it's like being on that end. I'm wondering what those of you who do would recommend I do. Is there something I'm doing wrong when I fall? Or possibly something wrong in his belay technique? Or is this just one of those unworkable things and I should stop projecting when he's belaying me?

Despite the fact that I'm 6'4"" my fingers are almost the exact same length as hers even though she's 5'7"" and has normal looking lady hands (they are about twice as thick as hers though). And my fingers have actually gotten a little sausagier since I started climbing six months ago. I don't really care that much (although I'm pretty sure my wing wanger is a little below average\-sized since the thumb tip to pinky tip length thing is definitely true), but for the most part I've found having stubby hands to be a disadvantage in most things (e.g. piano, sign language, finger banging) and it would be nice to know they're good for something. Thinking about the physics it seems like having lil stumpers could actually make certain climbing grips like crimping easier, and the shorter length would probably also make them less injury prone. Is there anything to that? I know in weightlifting it's a generally accepted maxim that having shorter legs makes you better at squatting and shorter arms better at bench. I figure there are probably some hold types where longer fingers would allow you to get deeper into a pocket or crevice, but that overall that benefit isn't worth the increased stress longer fingers have placed on them with almost every hold.",climbing,1528825571,SleepyConscience,7,1,True,2018-06-12

44,"The 5.10- climber's guide to the Bow Valley, Canada","Hey /r/climbing \- I created this post as an answer to another post earlier today, and I though I would re\-post it for the benefit of anyone who has possibly never heard of the area, or is thinking of visiting. 

While the Canadian Rockies are best known for long, chossy alpine climbs and 5.13 limestone sport climbing, there is more than enough 5.10\- climbing to entertain the budding sport climber looking for a unique destination with lots of options. 

The season runs from May until early October (most years), and June can sometimes bring a fair bit of rain so plan accordingly. 

Also be aware it gets pretty busy here in the summer, so be sure to book campsites and accommodations ahead of time.

**Most recommended Guidebook:** [Bow Valley Sport](https://www.quickdrawpublications.com/product/bow-valley-sport/) \- Beautifully illustrated sport guidebook featuring high quality crag images with lines showing individual routes, comprehensive descriptions for every single route in the entire book, and featuring all of the very best sport climbing crags in the Canadian Rockies. Relatively inexpensive at $35, and very high quality. The latest edition (out now) contains all routes including those put up as recent as 2017.

* [River Run](https://gripped.com/news/new-nine-pitch-banff-sport-route-is-river-run-5-10/) (5.10d, 8 p) \- Doable for a 5.10\- climber. Excellent climbing and well bolted (20m app, easy walk off)

* [Tall Storey](http://sendage.com/climb/tall-storey-tall-storey-wall-echo-canyon-ab-canada) (5.11c, 8 pitches) \- I know it's beyond what you requested, but adding as it's easily one of the very best sport multipitch routes in Canada, if not North America.

Some suggestions for crags in the Bow Valley withe some recommended 5.8 \- 5.10c routes

* [Sunshine Rock](http://sendage.com/area/sunshine-rock-ab-canada) \- The most accessible crag in Western Canada with a 30 second walk and a decent selection of 5.7 to 5.11a routes. Probably the best crag for the budding 5.9/5.10a climber with a huge range of routes in the 5.8ish range.

* [Lake Louise](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/107231400/lake-louise)/Back of the Lake \- ([Route List](http://sendage.com/area/lake-louise-ab-canada)) \- One of the very best Sport &amp; Trad climbing venues in Canada, if not North America. Plenty of variety from 5.6 sport to 5.14 trad. 20 minute access on a flat trail, however a LOT of tourists as this is a very popular tourist destination.

* [Grassi Lakes](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105893722/grassi-lakes) \- ([Route List](http://sendage.com/area/grassi-lakes-ab-canada)) \- Easy access (15 minutes) and a huge range of climbing (5.4 \- 5.13c). Most climbing in the 5.10\-5.11 range. Really unique limestone formations with huge holes and pockets on steep rock. Kinda like gym climbing, popular with locals after work, but horrifically overrun by tourists on a summer weekend. Wear a helmet... mountain goats knock rocks down on people almost daily.

* [Cougar Canyon](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105953176/cougar-canyon) \- ([Route List](http://sendage.com/area/cougar-canyon-ab-canada)) Easy access (15\-50 minutes) with a massive range of climbing and hundreds (thousands?) of routes. Known as the best 5.10 crag in the valley with lots of 5.8 climbing and routes up to 5.14d at Planet X near the back of the canyon. Recommended routes:
* **Poker Face** (5.10a)
* **King of Clubs** (5.10a)
* **Byzantium** (5.10b)

* **Flush** (5.9)
* **Entropy** (5.10a)
* **Critical Mass** (5.10c)
* **Pin Toe Flakes** (5.10c)
* **Open Season** (5.9)
* [Black Feather Canyon](http://sendage.com/area/black-feather-canyon-ab-canada) \- Slightly longer access than everything else in this list, but an extremely worthy day out for a number of high quality 5.10 routes. About 45 minute walk (bring bear spray!). Recommended Routes:
* **Sister Ray** (5.10c)
* **Holiday in Cambodia** (5.10b)

12,Some Thoughts on Top Rope Soloing,"Hey guys,

Had some fun by myself today and noticed a few things.

Normally, I TR solo with the microtraxion elevated by necklace, attached to a dog bone which is clipped to hard points, with jumar on belay loop, below, as back up. Basically, its exactly how petzl recommends.

However, Im constantly annoyed by how using a dog bone creates a ninety degree turn for the mixrotrax, which leads to occasional ""catching"" where the microtrax will sag any time my body scrunches. This fucks with the sliding function and I often have to pull rope through manually. 

After using this method and going crazy for the last few months, I switched things up in the middle of my session. 

I took away the jumar, and just clipped the microtrax to my belay loop with an anti-crossloading carabiner, still elevated by a necklace to minimize fall/force. Every so often I tied backup-stopper knots in case the microtrax disengaged and slid me down the rope. 

This was extremly liberating, and from then on I had zero problems, regardless of whether or not I was scrunched up or straightened out.

I know, Im gunna die.

Because I sometimes like to lean towards caution, i would like to have a secondary device still... Does anyone make a dogboje that has a ninety degree twisy in it (This would keep things in line so pulley slides and is oriented straight).

Or does anyone else solo TR with just one progress capture device? Ive seen people do it occasionally, but never took the time to say (in person) ""arent you worried about bla bla bla?""

Im gunna die...

30,Mentally getting over a bad fall + injury,"So I mostly boulder indoors and have done for years. Or I did until 4 months ago when I got a nasty compound fracture to my left tib + fib due to a bad landing. Putting my hand on my shin and feeling my bone sticking out was not on my bucket list. 

It's going to be a fair while before I'm able to get back on the wall, but I'm slightly worried I'm going to struggle mentally getting over the fall when I do. 

I still goto the wall with my friends to spectate (on the plus side I don't have to prove my betas at the moment!) but watching others come off the wall really makes me cringe. I keep expecting people's legs to snap under them even with really safe falls. 

I'd be awesome to hear from others who have suffered a serious injury climbinf and then got back to it. How long did it take you to get it out of your head? How was it when you first for back on the wall?

32,My review of the Mad Rock Weaver,"I recently bought this shoe and just wanted to throw this up here bc there was a huge lack of feedback about the shoes, so I figured for anyone else interested I could at least help out. 

I wear a 10.5-11 in street shoe and 12 in evolv and got these in 11.5 for a pretty snug fit. 

Pros
- Nice shape. Slightly downturned but still comfy
- Knit upper is breathable, keeping feet cool and the shoes smelling nice 
-Tongue is one single sock-like piece of fabric
- Science friction rubber is super sticky (although I am worried how well it will hold up)
-Heel suctions nicely

Cons
-Tongue is a sweat magnet! I let it air out after every climb but over time it may be an issue 
- Very steep difference in the rubber on the bottom of the shoe between the midsole and front, which feels awkward when walking. No big deal though
-My biggest complaint is the back of the shoe above the heel. It’s very high, and makes walking in them uncomfortable 

I was worried about a lack of rubber on the toes for hooking, but it’s been fine. Like I said I am worried about how well the rubber will hold up but we will see. 

Bottom line- these are, imo, great value intermediate shoes. They retail for 100$, a price hard to beat. I will wear these until they’re very worn, but I wouldn’t get another pair because of the heel/back of shoe. 
Hope this helps someone!

40,How do you improve with feet placement in bouldering?,"I’ve noticed as I get better and looking towards ways to improve that the most obvious problems aren’t my arms but my feet. A route is always very difficult for me mainly because I have my feet positioned wrong. This is a big problem especially during competitions because I end up using my arms more a lot more than I need to. I just don’t get how some of this feet/leg moves work wonders and how people know that this is the right move.

I remember there was this simple V3 that had one move that was so irritating for me. I had to be a bit dynamic to get to it and then stop my momentum which wasn’t a problem as long as I had strength left. I remember one day I saw this person do that same move only completely static and the only thing she did differently than me is that instead of putting her left foot in a hold she just completely straighten her foot. I tried it myself and it worked wonders and I still don’t know how that completely balanced me to reach the next hold. 

There was this route in a competition that I was in yesterday that I was having trouble with and I was thinking of where I can put my right foot so I can dyno up. This one guy decided to simply smear the wall and that worked for me as well. I’ve tried making the decision of smearing in some routes but it always ends up being a bad decision cause the wall is so slippery in the situations I try.

Then there are these other weird moves like heel hooks or toe hooks which I’m awful at and the feet positioning for dynos. It just goes on and on and I don’t know how to improve on any of it. ",climbing,1528693607,8TheKingPin8,9,1,True,2018-06-11

I moved from the Bay Area to a small town with an old climbing gym, and while I enjoyed the mega gyms in the Bay Area, there's something really special and intimate about climbing and training hard in our small gym in town.

It's one of the most famous climbs in the world, it's rated 5.13+, climbing grades go from 5 to 5.15 (they go 5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 etc. Til 5.9, after that they go 5.10, 5.10a, 5.10b, 5.10c, 5.10d, 5.11 etc. The jump from 5.10a to 5.10b is the same as from 5.8 to 5.9). This is also 'trad' which is way harder than what I do which is sport (I clip things into bolts already in the wall, trad or 'proper' climbers put wedge thingys or spring loaded contraptions into cracks. You have to know how to safely place these so they'll hold your fall but also not be impossible to get out again. You also have to be able to hang on long enough to put it safely in.) To 'do' a climb you have to not weight the rope (not take breaks unless you're standing on a ledge or hanging on). It's 2,900 feet or 884 metres of climbing. The wall itself can take 3-5 days for 'normal' climbers. The nose in a day (which is what they did) is a common challenge, the first ascent of this route took WEEKS. they just broke the speed record a week ago, 3 days later they broke their own record and yesterday they broke their own record again to climb it in under 2 hours. It's superhuman. To put that in perspective my first multi pitch  (any climb that isn't up one rope length and back down) was 800ft, 5.4 level (really really easy if you just do one pitch of it) and it took us about 8 hours... they did 31 pitches, 2900 foot of 5.13 climbing in 1hr 58...",climbing,1528403852,annasmilesaway,11,1,True,2018-06-07

1,Getting hit by your climber as a belayer?,"Hello everyone, this is my first post ever so bear with me. I was just wondering if my situation has ever happened to anyone and how to avoid it next time, even tho I am pretty positive I know how. Also, dont be commenting with negative things like ""gumby"" or ""dumbass"" because we all have to learn somewhere and I am ""learning"" right now so I dont want to hear it. Anyways, here is the situation.....

Me and one of my buddies went single pitch sport climbing at an outside crag. I have been leading/outside climbing for about a year now, my friend having done it longer than me. Anyways, he is roughly about 40 or 50 lbs heavier than I am (which is a huge difference) and he went to try and send his hardest climb to date. When he was on the climb, it was a lot harder than he had expected and he had to take a fall. He was up near the next bolt from his last piece of gear, and he fell. Well he took a huge whip and ended taking about a 25 ft fall. As I flew up, I felt something come down on my head which I learned after was my climbers ass (pretty funny but actually did hurt my neck a little bit). He ended up lower than me and kind of closer to the ground than he should have/I would have wanted. My regular climbing partner is 20 lbs lighter than I am so I am used to belaying someone lighter than me. Has anyone ever gotten hit from their climber? We are all alright at the end and no one got injured.

Some key take aways I came up with:

1. Have a lot less slack out for someone who is that significantly heavier than you are. A LOT LESS.
2. I shouldn't even be belaying someone who has that much of a weight difference than me anyways.

Is there anything else to take away from this? Would love your guys comments/feedback. ",climbing,1528225667,dirrjm,76,1,True,2018-06-05

I'm planning a trip to Bishop for some night/early morning bouldering during Independence Day week/weekend. I'm going with a few friends for a part of it, but for some reason or another, they'll be splitting up to other places. As of now, I'm on my own for Saturday night/Sunday and had a couple of questions.

First, anyone else planning to be there for the weekend who could use an extra spot?

If no replies to the above, would it be really stupid to go alone, even if I tried to be careful finding lowballs with nice landings. I'd probably stick to sunrise bouldering instead of actual night climbing in this case.

31,"My memory of Tim and Jason. I'm not sure how many others on here knew them, but I'd be interested to hear others' stories. Rest in peace guys, you rocked!","I didn’t know Tim and Jason very well. I had met them once on El Capitan and spent no more than half an hour with them, but those guys were so nice, so psyched, and so impressive that the memory of meeting them resonated with me.

I was belaying my partner, Jordan, on the crux changing corners pitch of The Nose. It would be our first summit of El Cap that evening, and we were psyched. It must have been around 9 AM because we were already a couple pitches into an early start to ensure our success. Suddenly there were voices beneath us, and before I knew it there was another climber on the ledge.

At first I was worried–I felt like we were cruising, and getting passed by a party that is only slightly faster can be a headache for everyone involved. It was immediately apparent that wasn’t the case. 

I learned a lesson in efficiency as Tim said hello and shot me a friendly smile as he anchored his rope in even less time. 

“Is it okay if I clip into your gear? I think your cam is in the only placement.” Tim said as he immediately began the next pitch.

“Of course, go ahead.” Most people wouldn’t even ask. 

“Thanks. If I had an actual belay I would usually free this section\[10c\], but I prefer to have a real belay when I’m free climbing….

“Partner should be up here soon. He’s solid and won’t be in your way. I might come back down and get some water from him when he gets here.” 

A few seconds passed and Tim grabbed one of Jordan’s placements (still on self\-belay) and swung around the crux corner, out of sight.

Jason arrived as quickly as Tim disappeared. He was climbing the fixed rope while self belaying on two microtraxions (I appreciated the redundancy, and employ a similar setup now when I top\-rope solo). The last pitch was a tough looking 11\+ endurance fest. I was glad that I was aiding. This guy was psyched to be freeing it for the 100th time. 

“WOOOOOOO! I’m top roping the Nose!!!” were the first words that I heard out of Jason. 

They had started just about five hours earlier, and were about to stand on top in no more than an hour. We had started five days earlier, and would stand on top that evening.

“You guys are doing it the right way.” Said Jason. 

“Take a week your first few times and just enjoy being up here.” 

Jason continued to pull up the end of his rope so that he could belay Tim, but the rope snagged beneath. 

“Guess I’ll have to go down and fix it.” Said Jason as he was already clipped in and rapping back down the fixed line. Meanwhile Tim finished the next pitch on his own, arrived at the next anchor with Jordan, and immediately began climbing again. (Jordan later remarked that it was like getting passed by the incredible hulk.)

A minute later and Jason was already back at the belay.

“The carabiner got stuck sideways in the crack. I’ve never seen that happen before. I wanted to climb that pitch again anyways! These upper pitches are so good!”

We talked a bit more, about where we lived, how long we have been climbing, and what we did for work. Jordan and I are both astronomers, which Jason was excited to learn.

“We’re sharing the wall with geniuses!” he shouted up to Tim.

I was flattered, and meanwhile I was honored to be sharing the wall with these two superhumans who were making quick time out of the biggest accomplishment of my life. 

And as quickly as they arrived, they were gone. This time, simply above us and out of sight thanks to their remarkable speed, on to run down the East ledges and be back relaxing in the valley before noon (or starting another run up the Salathe for all I know). 

A few days ago the story, which started out for Tim and Jason as it had hundreds of times at the base, ended in a different way. Those guys chose to live their lives on the wall, as I do and so do so many of my friends and loved ones. 

They had been up the wall hundreds of times before, so they had reason to feel comfortable with greater than a ninety\-nine percent safety margin, and their families had reason to trust in their abilities.

We’ll never know exactly what precipitated the fall of these El Cap heroes. To make sense of it, and to try to justify our own continued climbing, the community has been vibrantly speculating what might have happened. 

Was a haul bag dropped from above? Did a hold break? Did poor gear blow out of the wall? Was there even any gear in between them? Is simuclimbing unsafe? Is it time to stop focusing on speed climbing? Why are Alex and Tommy still breaking the record on the Nose just a few days after all of this? 

In my short time as a climber, I’ve learned that geology is an ongoing process, and that climbers are part of the equation. I won’t speculate much on what happened, but my guess is that on a section of rock that Jason knew well, he found a moment in time in which all of the previous geologic forces (including Jason’s previous passage of the same rock, and my own) added up to change the environment in a way that he did not expect. Maybe a hold broke, maybe a block blew out of the crack, maybe Jason stepped and slipped on one of El Cap’s notoriously gooey worms. 

All that we know with certainty is that they fell from a section that they were capable of traversing as easily as the front stairs to their home, so it seems that something weird happened. At least, to preserve the memory of our friends and heroes we hope that something weird happened. We also selfishly hope that something weird happened so that we can justify our own climbing, and ignore the potential cold reality that the families of Jason and Tim are feeling right now. 

For now, when I think of climbing I can only think of Tim and Jason. I try to start a workout, but just stop. They are all that I can think about. Was it worth it for them all of the times that they worked out in pursuit of their remarkable climbing fitness? Did it simply drive them to their end? If they were here now, would they encourage their friends to give up climbing and spend time with their families?

I think they wouldn’t. Climbing is what made those guys whole, as it makes me whole. Such a heavy loss is hard to bear, but it also reminds us of how beautiful and remarkable it was to share the experiences with them that we have. 

I would give up climbing in a heartbeat if Jason could meet his soon to be delivered child, or if Tim could spend one more day with his wife and kids, but I can’t turn back time. The least that I can do is to preserve the one memory that I have of them, before it fades with time.  

I think we can find a sort of peace in knowing that our community is different thanks to Tim and Jason. I only spent twenty minutes with them, and the encounter charged the past two years of my life with psych and inspiration. I can only begin to imagine the collective effects that they have left among us. ",climbing,1528306592,k-wagner,16,1,True,2018-06-06

I went ahead and clipped into the one above my head because I was on a decent ledge and felt comfortable, then continued climbing a couple more feet, when I hear him yell up and ask me to lower down and clip the one I skipped. I just did what he asked without thought, as he has taught me everything I know this far and I know he's super safety oriented.

My question is, was he just being overly cautious, or is there a real reason for him asking me to do that? I see videos of climbers running things out like crazy, and this didn't feel anywhere near that unsafe.",climbing,1528325469,ThrowThatBitchAway69,38,1,True,2018-06-06

It's not as lengthy as it seems as the references list is very  long. Please note that I'm not trying to tell you what to do. I'm just trying to educate and spread awareness since my life was changed significantly by a minor concussion. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK326721/

""Our findings suggest a higher propensity of top-of-the-head impacts and a higher relative risk of concussion for those impacts. In one of our published papers, six of thirteen concussions occurred from impacts to the top of the head, which is in contrast to four, two, and one concussions occurring to the front, right, and back, respectively (Figure 2.1)."" 

^takeaway: Especially wear a helmet while belaying.

""Thus, despite the literature suggesting that high magnitudes of head impact, particularly with high angular acceleration, result in more serious clinical outcomes in cases of moderate or severe TBI,71,72 the magnitude and location do not predict clinical recovery in cases of sport-related concussion.""

^takeaway: Even minor bumps can cause a TBI. You don't have to be knocked out or bleed from the nose to have a TBI.

""As many as 50% of these sport-related concussions go unreported.78 The factors contributing to the underreporting of concussive injury are multifactorial and include gaps in knowledge concerning concussion symptoms, beliefs that the injury is not serious, and unwillingness to be removed from competition""

My name is Tom Sanderson and I am a Toronto based climber and outdoor enthusiast. I work at an awesome gym called Basecamp Climbing (located in downtown Toronto) and as a part time customer service associate in the climbing/camping department of MEC.

I am in the process of starting a clothing and accessory company called Climb Local. My goal is to sell products with designs inspired by local crags, climbing communities and areas that are not necessarily represented by bigger brands (ie. The North Face). My secondary goal (which is equally important) is to take a portion of the profits and inject them back into climbing communities, access coalitions, climbing festivals, re-bolting initiatives, environmental clean up and sustainability projects, etc. thereby creating a company that both grows and helps strengthen the climbing community at the same time.

With the above description in mind, would you buy product and/or support a company like Climb Local?

If the idea of a company like Climb Local excites you please let me know! I am currently looking for artists, graphic designers and illustrators to help create designs of local crags that inspire and motivation them to get outside!

Any and all feedback is welcome thanks for your comments!

Cheers,

Setting up on a different route:
2 bolt anchor, double length sling tied with figure 8, locker on masterpoint. Clove hitch into locker and on the non weighted rope strand I tie a figure 8 on a bight for redundancy/backup on a single bolt. (Or should I just do a figure 8 on the locker and the extra figure 8 as backup?

Also I just plan on using a grigri to rap on a single strand to get into position, tieing an overhand/figure 8 on a bight as a catastrophe knot while actually taking the photos.

Does this all check out or am I missing something more obvious/easier?

Lastly, what is a safe way to take a shot from above the climber on the same route? If the photo was do-able from the anchor I would just clove into the anchor with the extra rope flaked over my clove rope/personal anchor.
But if I am trying to get an overhead shot say halfway down the route, how would I do this without having my rope in the way? My first thought is a saddlebag style rap and tying a knot below the belay device and then going hands free.

I'm a novice climber.

So, now I'm sat at home waiting for the swelling to go away on my ankle, and wish to live vicariously.

17,TIFU by leaving water bottles in my pack's water bottle pockets while rappelling. Lesson learned: keep all personal belongings secure!,"Putting this out there because I find it useful to read about other's mistakes and hope this will benefit someone. This probably should be common\-sense, but clearly it wasn't for me yesterday.

Yesterday I was rappelling down from a top\-rope anchor with the masterpoint set a decent amount over the edge \(probably about 1 foot\). I pre\-rigged my rappel and started the downclimb to the masterpoint. Then I felt my footing slip and took a hard fall onto the rope.

The fall was a little jarring, but I was fine. However, as I fell I heard two large thuds on the ground below me. When I looked down, I saw that my water bottle and thermos had fallen out of the backpack pockets and taken a 70\-foot fall onto the ground where both my partners were standing. Fortunately, they didn't hit anybody, and the only thing damaged in the fall was the water bottle \(see below\). However, if my partners had been standing somewhere else, or if hikers had been going past, it clearly could have been much worse.

**What went wrong**: First and foremost, leaving the water bottles in the pockets. I was rushing a bit to get my stuff together, and if I hadn't been I might have thought to pack them inside the pack. Secondly, my partners were not wearing helmets at the time. While the primary responsibility rests entirely with me, a helmet would have been invaluable if the falling objects had hit them. 

Beyond that, the masterpoint probably didn't need to be quite so low, especially since we knew we'd be rapping off it. I also had gotten a little blasé about the downclimb to TR anchor rappels after many rappels without incident and wasn't being as careful as I could have.

**What went right**: Rappel was extended and backed up with an autoblock, and hand stayed on the brake strand the whole time. Had this not been the case, it easily could have been me that was falling to the ground in addition to my water bottles. That being said, in future situations like this I'm going to connect myself to an anchor point with an instructor's tether for added safety.

just wanna hear around if anyone had something like this before ..?

Last night, I woke up around 3 AM from a burning pain on the inside of my left elbow. I would describe it as something like a cramp, and it occured at or very close to the location that some ligaments run through the ellbow. After some agressive stretching and rolling around, the pain got less (can't have taken more than 1-2 minutes) and I went back to sleep. Today, I still feel the faintest hint of remaining soreness in this part, but no pain or anything. I also didn't feel pain there before I went to sleep.

For context: I have been bouldering for three years (pretty much all the time) and the last two days I tried pretty hard with 2-3 hours training each day. 

Could it be a cramp? A ligament cramp? And what can I do against it? I am warming up thoroughly (stretching, activating muscles etc.) for 15 minutes each session, and cooling down on the easiest route the gym has to offer. That being said, my muscles felt a bit sore going in the session yesterday, but it subsided a bit as the session was ongoing. However, I stopped when I began to feel really weak.

Last time I went, the new manager of the gym told me they can't allow my dog to be in the backpack while I climb the wall because they don't want to be liable if he gets hurt since they don't have a dog waiver for me to sign to release that liability.

52,Alpine boulder/horn rope anchor?,"I was recently out on a climb and buddy showed me a rope anchor that is quick to construct, creates an anchor from the rope for the leader, and sets up a guide mode belay, however I can't remember exactly how it is constructed, nor do I know its name.  The anchor would be best for a quick belay at a large boulder or horn on a ledge after low class 5 climbing.  See attached diagram:

https://imgur.com/5KDu8ry

The jist is this:

1. Leader arrives at boulder after low class five potentially topping out on climb.
2. Leader takes bight of rope and wraps it around the entire boulder, linking it back to its original strands.  One of the original strands goes to the follower, one to the leader.
3. Here's where I forget what's going on.  A carabiner (blue) is placed at the intersection and attached to all four strands in some girth hitch formation which anchors both the follower and the leader.
4. An ATC can be placed onto the biner in guide mode, the rope pulled up, and the follower put on belay.

This method is ideal for scenarios where the boulder is too big for cordalette, where the anchor is a chockstone, or you just wanna move fast.

The V2 started off with a straight dyno to my left. The hold was good but no matter how hard I tried my hands wouldnt stick to it. There was also a good foot hold right underneath it the only problem with that is if I go straight for it my knee will hit the other holds in the way since this rock wall is kinda shaped like a cylinder. The V3 was a but simpler with its dyno as I only had to jump a little more to reach the hold which I had no problem but no matter how well my hands land on that hold the momentum I used to jump that far push me past the hold to where my hands can’t stay on.,climbing,1527658638,8TheKingPin8,5,1,True,2018-05-30

My current setup is a trango cinch in the belay loop and a prusik on top of it as backup. 

The cinch proved to be very reliable, the rope never slipped enough to make the prusik grab the rope. The prusik on the other hand will sometimes provide too much friction to let the rope slide through without pulling it down by hand.

I now had the idea to replace the prusik by a ct rollnlock or a petzl microtraxion tied into the belay loop and held up by a rubber cord in the chest harness.
This device would then be the main device to catch a fall while I could still easily descend with the cinch or reconfigure the setup to jumar up if I can't climb the section.

If you've personally climbed Mont Blanc, I'd also love it if you left you're name in the comment (or PM me), and I can give you credit. Honestly, I've mucked around on mountains in Canada, and I've done a TON of hiking and that, but nothing like Mont Blanc, and I don't won't to do a disservice to my readers by writing something that they could find on wikipedia, so anything helps. 

If you do take the time to leave a comment, it's much appreciated, and thanks. If not, that's all gravy as well, as it's to a potentially narrow audience. That being said, even if you haven't climbed Mont Blanc but want to add something, go ahead. I promise I'm not that asshole writer who will steal your words, I just want to be the quality writer who has more context than most. ",climbing,1527259904,fairlywittyusername,3,1,True,2018-05-25

29,Why is purchasing a trad rack treated as an out-of-reach and preposterous purchase?,"So often do I see posts about how preposterous and boujee buying a trad rack is. Why tho? 

To start, yes, it is no small chunk of change to make the commitment to your first starter rack. And I know that in climbing there is a wide range of participants here from low income (down all the way to NO income, hello students), to people who are well off. That is one of my favourite parts of climbing, actually is the variance of characters that are out there. 

What grinds my gears is that across the board, there seems to be this stigma that buying/learning to use a trad rack is ridiculous. 

Now as a lover of many sports, I try to live financially responsible as to allow myself to purchase tools/toys for the outdoors as well as trips to take me on fun adventures around the country and the world. Like many of you. From what I have seen from the sports I am involved in, climbing, and specifically, trad climbing is no different than the other action sports. 

For example:

Backpack: $250+ for a tent, $250+ for a sleeping bag, $250+ for a backpack, $100 for a sleeping pad, and boots/shoes, stove, and maybe another $300+ dollars for clothes more specific to backpacking and you have approximately $1000 worth of gear for that. 

Mountain Biking: a mid-level bike probably costs you $1500. And I bet if you mountain bike you might road bike or cyclocross or whatever so add another $1500. 

And yes, you can purchase these items used to save LOTs of money, whereas purchasing a trad rack used is ill-advised for obvious reasons. 

That being said, if climbing is your main passion, I don't feel purchasing a trad rack is really that expensive for how many hours of fun and new routes it gives you. Find a mentor, read, watch, study, and climb safe.

So, questions:

* I've heard mixed reviews that Shelf Road may a bit hot in June. Thoughts? (Also keep in mind that we're from Texas, so 100+ degrees and 90+% humidity is pretty normal for us...)

* We're looking to climb for sure on a Thursday and Friday, hoping that going on weekdays will mean less people out. May or may not climb on a Saturday or Sunday as well, depending on how we're feeling and the amount of non-climbing activities we want to do. I'm assuming/have heard that Boulder Canyon and CCC will be pretty busy on weekends - is this true of Shelf Road as well? If we did go to Boulder Canyon/CCC on a weekend, where are we likely to find less people?

* Is the local ethic in these places to rap or lower or does it not matter?

* On the sport routes, are there typically ... something up top? (Whether that be sport clips, or rap rings, or...?) 

* Guidebooks - which ones should we be looking at? Is there a place to rent them? Or just go old-fashioned Mountain Project?

* Any must-do or classic single-pitch sport routes? I can finagle my way up to 10a/b on polished Texas limestone.

* Do you have non-climbing suggestions for food, drinks, hikes, and general fun?

62,I let go with my break-hand. Can I get your input?,"Was at a climbing gym recently for the first time. Passed their test to top rope and lead. While belaying my friend up his warm up route, the rope got a kink in it and wouldn't feed through. He was at the top of the wall trying to clip into the last draw.

Being relatively new to lead climbing (I had been on maybe 5-7 climbing trips since learning) I got flustered and instead of holding the break line and flaking out the rope, or flaking out with the opposite hand, I let go with my break hand and fixed the issue. Didn't even realize I had done that. 

After my friend got down, the owner of the gym came over, pulled my lead certification saying I could've killed my friend (he's not wrong) and chastised me for doing that and chastised my friend for not being more upset with me. 

Do you all think that was the best reaction? I'm glad he came over and explained what I did wrong but I feel like me lead belaying the rest of that day would've been better since I'd be more aware of that then normal. He said I needed more experience before lead belaying. Not sure how I would get that experience without lead belaying. 

As a more broad question, do you agree lead/top rope certs should be required at gyms? If their partner trusts them to belay/climb correctly, what does it matter?

Now these are two very finger stressful sports, so I guess it's not surprising that my hands are starting to show sign of wear and tear.
My middle finger of my right hand has developed a light trigger finger (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_finger) whereby it locks in bent position.
I have been told that this could of occurred because my fencing grip was incorrect (too much force on the ring and middle fingers, rather than the thumb and index fingers), but I suspect my climbing may have contributed also.

My questions are:
- Are there effective home remedies that can address the symptoms of trigger finger?

I mainly do sport climbing on the rocks \(6a/6b\) and indoor bouldering.On normal shoes I wear the size 45 \(it should be an 11.5 US size\).There are few shops in my area, I visited the two most known and that probably also have the biggest selection but I did not succeeded in finding a pair that fits me.

The first problem is simply that for most of the model I'm interested in, there are no sizes for me.

The only shoes I managed to wear after a lot of effort were not fitting me well. 

In some rare cases I could fell empty spaces here and there.

But in most of the cases the problem is only on the heel area.

My thoughts so far on the classics: 

 \- It comes with 6 pieces, but it sounds like in practice I'll only use the middle 4

 \- The set is more expensive \($120\), but the price per piece is cheaper \($20 per tricam\)

My thoughts on the Evos:

 \- It only comes with 4 pieces, but they're the 4 I'm most likely to use. \- The set is cheaper \($100\), but the price per piece is more expensive \($25 per tricam\)

 \- They can be placed in passive mode the wide direction \(3 types of placement, rather than the classic tricam's 2 types\), but I doubt I'll ever use that because I already have a full set of nuts. I imagine I will only place tricams in active mode in horizontal cracks.

I have a few limestone trips coming up and want to find something more appropriate. More specifically, a shoe that's stiffer like a muira. The muira vs fit my foot shape pretty badly and the regular anasazi doesn't fit my foot at all for some reason.  I tried on the new anasazi pros and they fit perfectly.

1,my crappy old fingers,"Left middle finger, first joint, has been giving me grief lately. Sometimes after a hard day climbing, I'll get a little knot on the left side of the top of the knuckle, which I am assuming is a little synovial cyst or something because I can't figure out what else it would be. Also a bit painful to wiggle the finger laterally at the first joint.

 My finger will be a bit stiff for a couple days and then it will feel mostly fine, just in time for my next climb!  I've tried resting it for up to two weeks, which feels like forever, but apparently isn't long enough. I've tried icing it with seemingly little accomplished.

My insurance sucks, and I've convinced myself that if I go to a doctor, they'll just tell me to rest it, if they can figure it out at all.

Does this sound familiar to anyone? Can/should I climb through it or do I need to take real time off? I don't like that it has hampered my climbing by a grade or two, but what I'm really worried about is the possibility of doing permanent damage to it by not resting it now.

8,I almost decked from the anchor today due to poor communication.,"I was involved in an accident at Beer Walls, a popular trad cragging spot not far from the road in Keene, NY (Adirondacks).

My partner and I discussed our plan when we arrived at the wall. He would lead one route and lower I would clean the gear and lower. I would lead the second route, and use the same tree anchor as the first route to belay him up so we could walk off without leaving any gear (a bit quicker, a bit easier on the tree we used as an anchor, and an easy walk off). This cliff was about 40 ft tall. 

Before my lead, we decided that we should also set up a top rope over a third route in line with out anchor, we ended the conversation with different assumptions. He thought I was going to belay him from above, I thought we was going to lower me (I thought it was understood that top roping the third route meant that belaying him up and walking off after the second route pointless). 

So I lead the pitch, clip into the anchor. He says ""let me know want you want to come off."" I responded with ""yeah, I'm ready to go."" We made one of our mistakes here: using causal speech in place of standard commands. We both agreed later that if he said used the phrasing ""take you off belay"" (as we are both more used to hearing) or if I had responded with ""take"" (as we would expect before a climber is lowered) then one of us would have realized our mistake. But we got complacent.

I stepped back and fell. For a moment I thought I was simply being lowered faster because I had gone over the edge and my weight was more on the rope. But I kept going. And going. I stopped suddenly, and felt a pain in my ankle, knowing immediately that it was sprained. 

I looked down, and I was only ten feet off the ground. My partner was visibly shook, and his hands were not on the brake strand. In fact, I wasn't on belay at all. What had stopped my fall was his grigri rammed against my first piece of protection. 

The rope was still in the grigri, but my partner had already removed the locking carabiner that he had used to attach it to his belay loop. The grigri was oriented such that the climbers strand of the rope was under tension (from my fall) and had been pulled up against my first piece of pro. Thankfully, the grigris cam was able to engage without being depressed (as many grigri users do to pay out slack quickly) by the carabiner on my first piece of pro. 

My partner was so shaken that he said he needed to sit down. I kindly asked him to put me back on belay first. He did, using his other belay device. Then, I found a stable stance were I could manually depress the grigris cam, remove it from the rope, and had my partner take, and then lower me to the ground. 


We identified a couple ways in which this accident could have been avoided:

-Being deliberate and clear on what we would do before I left the ground.

-using the proper commands (take, lower or off belay, belay is off). 

We think our complacency stemmed from a couple things:

-him asking me if I needed to come off: there are not standard questions. There are standard commands. If he had simply waited for me to say ""off belay"" (or rather, ""take"") as I would have we would have realized our mistake. 

-we were acting more casually about easy, short pitches. We've done far longer routes together, far harder routes together, and climbed in situations where communication was more difficult. These reasons are not excuses to cut corners when things are simple, even with partners you're familiar with 

I feel as though I am rather safety-concerned as climbers come. It only took me one fuck up to come very close to injury. It would be irresponsible of me not to consider what would have happened if my partner had enough time to finish removing his grigri, or if it didn't lock up when it did (or if the first piece that it rammed against had popped). My partner said my feet were at head level as I fell. It is questionable whether or not I would have landed on the large area of soft dirt, or been cracked like an egg over the boulder three feet to the right. 

I'm posting this to remind everyone to be safe out there and to encourage dialogue about proper communication between partners. Please learn from our mistakes. Use your agreed upon partner commands loud and clear, every time. Think critically about you and your partners' habits. Climbing is an incredible privilege that I plan on enjoying for as long as I am able. I'd rather be a little paranoid than paralyzed (or worse) from an accident. Stay safe. Much love, Ben.

Long story short, started climbing in a gym, loved it, suscribed for a year :) I m at my 4th session, climbing 5C, and thinking about buying shoes (tired of renting them lol).

I HAVE to buy them online, cause i live in a small island lost at sea (new caledonia), so mostly, i won't be able to try them, and i have to do a shit ton of research online for sizing etc, that's where your help would be really welcome, your experience is important :)

I did a lot of research online, and it's quite hard to find good information that is not sponsored etc...

As far as i understand i would want some ""not too agressive"" shoes (because i m a beginner, i m limited by my physical ability not my shoes i m sure hehe) fit / snug but not toe killer shoes, that allow me to progress / evolve :)

Any advice? It seems like the tarantulace could be a good choice, but some review says they die quickly, shit durability... and i can't resole the shoes where i live, so mostly, if they need a resole, they are dead... Scarpa helix too, etc...

I climbed a mixed route this weekend that had a shared anchor. After I climbed it, I pulled the rope but left the gear/draws so someone else could lead it sport style. My partner climbed it and cleaned the route, a little while later we realized the two draws from the anchor weren't mine. Someone had climbed up a neighboring route, saw two draws on the anchor and another one below it and assumed it was all booty and took my draws off the anchor and replaced it with their own. There are very few scenarios where someone will leave two draws behind on an anchor as booty. Please don't take them if you see them there with out at the very least asking those around you.

As I caught it, my grip went from a closed grip crimp to an open grip crimp, with no foothold, and I think I sprained my C3 pulley on my middle finger due to that.

And I decided to take a break from climbing for a while until the pain went away. However, I still want to do my pt so is it okay if I do them with a [false grip](https://i.imgur.com/WZjneX8.jpg)? My middle finger doesn't hurt in that position but was wondering if the false grip would affect blood flow to the finger or retard its healing in any way. Thanks in advance!

I thought I should try again so we could have a more productive discussion. Thus, I've decided to repost my second edit here. If this is inappropriate, please let me know.

Basically this was I was trying to say:

People are all different and therefore have different experiences and different interactions with the rest of the world. Therefore, we should refrain from assuming that other people have the same experience as us. I think we can all agree so far. If you disagree, please don't tell me so I can give in my optimistic bliss for a just a bit longer. Anyways, I was trying to apply this mantra to heights in climbing. Someone might be the shortest climber in their group, but it doesn't mean that their experience would be the same or applicable to someone who is significantly shorter than them. I wanted people to be more cognizant of that fact that it is very counter-productive and inconsiderate to tell someone visibly shorter than you that the move isn't that reachy, or that they should be able to do it with your beta etc etc, just because you consider yourself to also be short. Remember, height isn't black and white, it's a gradient. You might be the shortest (or tallest) among your friends, but other people can still be a lot shorter (or taller) than you.

I think I may have assumed that some of you disagreed with my first point (the premise of the discussion), and I may have therefore responded harshly to you. If that happened, please forgive me.

27,Looking for developers/designer for BoulderShare - a platform for sharing boulder problems,"Hi /r/climbing! I’m looking for climbers that are also developers to help me develop this app which could help millions of climbers around the world. I’m open to ideas so anyone who applies can give their suggestions to make this app better.

Please read more information on the project below, and if you’re interested please apply by sending an email to *bouldershare@gmail.com*. Feel free to send a link to this thread to your friend that happens to be a great developer/designer!

**Bouldershare - android app**
I found a bit of free time and developed [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.herak.bouldershare). It is android only and allows you to take a photo of a climbing wall and mark holds on the photo as well as add some data on the problem (grade, author, comment, etc.). You can then share this photo with all the added that via any android app you have installed that supports image sharing. 

This is my first and only android app, so it is not a great piece of software but the idea is fine. The only problem is that you can then share this as a JPEG to Facebook, Whatsapp, Viber, etc. but that is simply not practical and is only shared with people you really know. What about others in your gym? How will you get all the cool problems that someone you don’t know has created?

**Bouldershare.com - web app**
This is the solution to the above problem. A social climbing platform, focused on sharing boulder problems. Each problem would have a grade, a gym tag and this would enable you to find boulder problems for a gym where you’re currently at and filter those problems by grade (specify a range of grades you’re looking for).

You can mark problems as climbed and have your log book, you can rate the problems and leave comments to a problem.

The web app should be responsive and optimized for mobile use since the majority of users will use it in the climbing gym, but I expect many users would use it at home to browse problems, find the ones they wish to climb in the next session, etc.

Integration with the android app (and hopefully iOS) would be supported (one-click upload of the image and data to bouldershare.com and publishing under your username - you’d need to authorize the android app to use your bouldershare.com account). The mobile apps, however, are not mandatory, you can mark your problems in any photo editing app, upload the image and manually enter the other data (grade, comment, etc.).

I have a lot of ideas how to make it even better, but this is the core where we need to start. Dedicated gym pages and gym admins would come in the next step (they’d be able to mark problems as “old” when the holds are removed for an example). Online friendly competitions (add 10-20 problems, people apply and mark which routes have they climbed). And much, much more. But as I’ve said, let's keep it simple for now and focus on the core functionalities listed above.

**Bouldershare - iOS app**
This is the logical step, if there is an android version, there should be an iOS version, at the moment bouldershare.com is a priority, but I’d very much like if someone would work on this as well. 

**Graphical design**
I’m really bad at this which can be seen from the way my app looks. So a designer is definitely required if we want to have a pretty product which we’ll all enjoy using. 
**Conclusion**
Thank you for taking your time and reading this post. Hopefully we can make a good team and a product which will help the whole climbing community!

P.S. Feel free to ask any questions in the comments, I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability.

Hello /r/climbing - wondering if any of you have dealt with this problem before. I'm based in DC, and during the climbing season, the most popular and accessible crag (Great Falls, VA/Carderock, MD) is nearly unusable due to classes run by local outfitters and gyms. The crag itself is in NPS land, and is free to access for anyone. 

However, every Saturday and Sunday the local gym (Earthtreks) and the three local REI locations all arrive around 0700 and set up ropes on around 70% of the available climbs, including most of the most technically challenging/interesting routes, for ""intro to climbing"" and ""TR anchor"" classes that run from 0900-1500 each day and net them about $150/student.

Obviously, it's great that more and more people are getting into climbing, but its frustrating as a local climber to have to scrounge for routes while two massive companies monopolize the walls while charging $150 a head for intro classes (on public land).

Is this normal? Anything that the rest of us could do to find some arrangement where we can also access the space? Have you ahd to deal with this at your local climbing spot? Given REI's reputation, you'd think they'd be interested in ensuring access to the crag for the community.",climbing,1526260136,profesh_lurker,58,1,True,2018-05-13

36,Kid DECKS at Regionals,"The crazy circumstances of how I decked on the speed wall at the 2018 Youth Regionals

So I am a male youth B competitor and this was my first year going to sport and speed regionals. Regionals was at Sender One Santa Ana, a two-hour drive away, and cost $110 to enter. For those reasons, I decided to enter speed on top of sport to make it worth it. What happened next was crazy. I don't have a speed wall at my gym so I am not very good at it but that doesn’t have to do with my fall. I grabbed the bad part of a hold and fell. But then I kept on falling, kept on falling, wondering when I would stop, but then hit the floor. At first I was thinking, “that was such a weird catch do they always do that for speed competitions” but the looks and shock on the crowd and competitors faces made me realize that it was not supposed to happen. Soon everyone began asking me if I was okay or hurt, from the judges to my dad to my friends and fellow climbers. The thing is, I thought everyone was over exaggerated because I felt completely fine. I got up, brushed myself off, and was ready to do my second run, but people looked at me like I was crazy. That was when the extant of the situation hit me. I looked at the part of the wall that I fell from. It was about fourth clip and 25 feet up. I couldn’t believe that I was okay after the fall. I got lucky and landed in a sitting position on my butt; that mixed with the padded floor was how I was okay. They made me sit out but I insisted I was okay I got back at the end of the running order for my second run. Because of the situation, I was hoping for a technical foul and to be able to redo my first run. My friend who had a rulebook was arguing with the judge over that I should be able to get a technical because of rule 5.15.1f that said an excessive amount of slack and improper belayer would count as a technical. But the judges and regional coordinators kept insisting that there was nothing wrong with my belay while I was climbing and it was wrong once I had already fallen off the wall and it was that the grigri didn’t activate. It wasn’t until two hours later that my friend and I reviewed the video and had seen what had actually happened. There was no second belayer to pull out the slack, something that every other person, even the person I was racing against, had had. My belayer either did not notice this, or didn’t think it was a problem. Because there was no one to pull out the slack from the grigri, he was just pulling the rope and it was accumulating in a big loop on top of the grigri. So when I fell, there was nothing to catch me at all. I am just so glad that I landed the way I did, on my butt and not hitting the podium that you start climbing on, or else I actually could have been greatly injured and maybe even paralyzed. I don’t know whose fault it specifically was, it could be between a number of people: the belayer for not asking for a second belayer, the second belayer for not even showing up, or even the three judges and two regional coordinators that didn’t notice there wasn’t a second belayer, which is a rule that there has to be one. A couple hours later I got approached by a Sender One lawyer who had to file an incident report of the event. I had to get inspected by an onsite medic who said that I appear to be fine, but the only way to know if any damage was ustained would be an mri or xray. They had me sign some paperwork, send them the video, and had my friend sign off as a witness. Too bad they didn’t compensate me in any way lol, I’m not gonna beg for it but a free day pass wouldn’t have hurt. In the end, it was a regionals I would never forget. Thanks for reading this crazy story, the one thing that I and you should learn about it is to always check belayers, no matter how professional they may be. The funniest thing is, due to the small amount of people competing in speed, I actually got into speed divisionals. ",climbing,1526263345,mathoolevine,122,1,True,2018-05-13

51,Went for my first top rope self-belay at Great Falls VA yesterday. Feedback on what stupid crap I did appreciated!,"[Pics](https://imgur.com/a/C5iZHWo)

Still clawing thru the guidebook to figure out exactly what route this was, but I do know it was maybe a hundred yards upstream of the Dihedrals.  I think it was just upstream of Microdome too.  Best I can figure, it's probably around 5.8-5.9.  About 80deg vertical, with only a couple of difficult moves.  Anchor was on 2 trees with a fig8 master point.  I rapped down on a reverso w/ prusik backup, then self-belayed on a GriGri2 w/ prusik backup, tying catastrophe knots every 10 feet or so.  Overall, a pretty easy climb with plenty of small ledges to stand on and take up slack/reset my belay.  Climbing outdoors by myself is way different than an autobelay in the gym, but it was great fun and I learned a lot!

Since Imgur glitched out and wouldn't let me add any more descriptions, here they are:

1) Looking down from on top

2) Looking down, but from the side this time

3) The climb from an adjacent peak

4) Some of the view from the top

5) More of the same

6) Ditto

7) Ditto

8) Halfway down the first rappel

9) Rappel setup.  Reverso in normal mode with a prusik on the break strands

10) Switched to self belay with the GriGri2.  Prusik on the break and catastrophe knot

11) Halfway back up!

12) Halfway up, looking back

13) Made it to the anchor

14) View of the anchor from the sharp end.  After the first climb, I put my backpack in the crack to reduce wear on the rope

15) All the way down from the top

16) A flower I saw growing in the rock

17) The same, but 50% more potato!

2. I'm not sure what happened to my fingers. I think I pulled it. I was climbing the other day \(Thursday\), and I was trying to hold on, but I kind of got yanked off by the movement of my body. This caused my ring and pinkie finger to start hurting a lot around the bottom part/bottom knucle. I taped it up during the rest of my climb, which helped. There wasn't really any pain the next day. Then Saturday I went climbing, but I avoided crimps and I didn't need to tape my fingers. However, I know my fingers are still pretty weak.

I am short. I am 5'1''. I know that I'm short, and I joke about it all the time. Often times I have to come up with completely different beta from most people, and I try to make friends with climbers my height so we can figure out the beta together. And it's fun trying to figure out a different solution! I can go on about my experiences being a short climber, but that's not what I wanted to talk about.

I am really annoyed by people who like to talk about being short, when they are not short. Sometimes it's guys who are below average height for men. It's like, yes I get it, you're short for guys, but still taller than an average woman, so not short. Sometimes it's girls who are below the average height for men, and I have no idea why they talk about being short, because they are often around average height for a woman. 

Just this weekend, a girl was trying to tell me that I should be able to make this really big move, because she could do it, and she's short, only 5'5''. I politely smiled at her and nodded, and said, ""Yeah I'll give it a try..."" However, in my mind, I was thinking, ""5'5''... so you mean average height for women in the US and Canada. WTF! That's not categorically short! That's called average.""

Please people, stop claiming that you're short when you're not.

So I have a partner that I climb with a lot. Our weight difference is somewhat substantial but it's always been manageable. Recently we were in the gym (so bolts are close and the first is pretty low) and he fell from a roof. I didn't have an abnormal amount of slack out but the fall still pulled me up to the first bolt. I arrived there pretty softly so if the bolt was a foot higher, there probably wouldn't be an issue BUT the problem ended up being that the carabiner on the permadraw was pressed tight against the lever of the Grigri I was using to belay. At first, I tried to climb up a little but I realized that any bit I climbed up, just lowered him down and made the situation worse. At this point, he's hanging in midair and can't get back on the wall so he can't climb back up either and we're basically stuck there. After fiddling for a couple minutes, I was able to twist the Grigri around to get an angle where the lever could operate but it was tricky and I'm not sure that would have worked in every situation.

After arriving in camp 4 on my first visit to Yosemite I got chatting to Jeff. We chatted about the valley and how I’d just been playing around in the boulders and that I really wanted to go do some trad but due to my lack of trad experience and lack of harness I couldn’t.

Jeff offered to take me climbing the next morning as he had a spare harness, we woke up and headed to swan slabs where he taught me to place gear and build belays. 

At noon he had to go home but just as he was doing so another climber came and asked if I would like to go climb. I explained that I would love to but have no harness. At this point Jeff turned to me and said “it’s your first time in Yosemite, you need to climb, keep the harness”. 

Jeff gave me his harness and I went on to have two amazing days climbing in the valley.

440,[Rant] Why are climbing shoes so expensive now in Canada?,"Up here in Canada, there are few shoes that are under $200, almost all of my go\-to shoes are around $210 \+ tax. What gives? It was around 2 years ago when shoes roughly doubled in price, and they've stayed there ever since. I climb indoors a lot during the winter, and typically go through a pair every 5\-6 months... it's starting to get slightly un\-affordable. 

Yes I know you can re\-sole shoes, however it costs upwards of $100 to resole a pair around here, and the resole jobs I've had typically last half as long and are not nearly as good as a new pair. Even that is getting hard to justify. 

Some Examples:

* 5.10 Pinks \- $210
* La Sportiva Miura \- $205/$225
* Evolve Shaman's $185
* TC Pros $229
* Solutions/Anasazi LV etc \- $225

The pain is bearable and usually only bothers me after climbing. I'm currently debating on if/when I should get it repaired with surgery.

448,Food for recovery?,"I've been experiencing some tendon soreness in my fingers (like a lot of other people) so I looked up ways to pre/rehab my fingers.  One thing I didn't really think about was if there were any kinds of food that could help aid the recovery. I read that walnuts and flax seeds help the tendon healing process. I added flax seeds to my smoothies and definitely noticed a change in my fingers over the last couple of weeks. They're definitely not as sore the next day, and I've noticed that I'm not losing as much mobility in my fingers anymore.


So I was wondering, do you have any other foods to help aid your recovery or set you up for a better session or rest day? Not just tendons, but any kind of foods you go to after a long day or strenuous session that could either help aid an injury, make you feel stronger before a session, help with muscle fatigue, etc.

15,Spooky moment in Smith today - an echoed fall,"Someone took a fall at Smith Rock today. I believe there was a belayer - climber miscommunication and a climber ended up falling 30ft from Rope-De-Dope. The climber survived, and here's the full writeup: 

http://www.ktvz.com/news/picnic-bench-breaks-smith-rock-climbers-30-foot-fall/738934843

I just wanted to relay a story from the moment. My group and I were across the river on Asterisk Pass. We were climbing quite happily until we heard the crash.

The crash was followed by screaming and yelling.

We looked across towards Rope-De-Dope and saw people running and swimming across the river. 

And while this was happening, every other climbing on our side of the river just became silent, unsure if there had been a rockfall because of the loudness of the crash. The feeling of dread and tension on everyone's faces was the same. It was a unifying moment of terror across all climbers near us. Everyone became silent as the yells from across the river echoed. It was surreal as the rest of the canyon went quiet while chaos went down below us.

Luckily, it seems like the climber will be okay. But that minute after the crash, with people running down below us is something that is going to stick with me. It's a stark reminder not to become lazy with safety checks and sufficient communication between climber and belayer. Of course I'll keep climbing, but it's put me into a somber headspace.

Does anyone know any tall climbers and have any advice on where to start? I have a really hard time staying close to the wall and following the “normal” holds with my wingspan. Bouldering also is flat out frustrating.

And advice or thoughts would be very appreciated! Thanks and climb on!

64,Are the baby head shaped holds meant as some kind of joke?,I originally saw this when I first started climbing two years ago. I was at Inspire Rock near Houston and I saw this top roping route that only had purple baby head shaped holds the whole way up. Just today I went to Austins Bouldering Project and one route had a massive purple baby head shaped hold for your feet. Is there some kind of weird story behind this specific hold and is there a name for this type of hold? Im assuming that it’s a slope.  ,climbing,1525763455,8TheKingPin8,15,1,True,2018-05-08

66,Placing pins to make holes instead of bolting?,"I'm developing a new area. I'm not allowed to bolt or leave any gear behind and for the most part I plan to free climb cracks. 

My problem is that when I have to cross a section of rock with no places for nuts or cams, how do I stay safe? 

I plan to place a pin and use that temporarily or remove the pin and use the hole for a small cam. There isn't anything illegal with this while bolting is. 

Anyone have advice on going about doing this? Would hammering a pin to fit a cam (in granite)  end up safer than placing and removing pins? I'd at least only have to damage the rock once. 

This seems the best solution to not placing bolts and avoiding running out my gear. Downside is I do damage the rock occasionally.

BrewHanger Climbing is a recently launched, charitable company based in Tucson, AZ. We donate 15% of any and all profits to re-bolting and access efforts (donations go directly to Access Fund Affiliates), and we've just released our first product!

The 3/8 Bottle Popper is built to the exact dimensions of the original SMC hangers (you know, the bolts that you're excited to get to after a long run-out on some sketchy slab only to realize that they probably won't do you any good, anyways). They're meant to signify innovation, the replacement of old, dangerous hardware and the celebration that's due after a safe, successful day in the mountains. 

Each Bottle Popper is manufactured locally out of hand-brushed 14 gauge stainless steel, so they're burly as hell (just like climbing gear should be), and come with a lifetime warranty.

Go check out BrewHanger.com, get yourself a Bottle Popper, go climb something rad, then open a summit beer with your newest piece of gear.

Happy Sending, and Cheers!

Me and my girlfriend have been dabbling in climbing for a few years \(2 for her, more like 6 on and off for me\). We have done a lot of indoor bouldering and climbing, some outdoor top\-roping that we have set up ourselves, and have also gone sport\-leading with friends. I have led 3 or 4 outdoor routes over the years, under the watchful eye of more experienced friends. We have brought our own gear with us on our road\-trip to the southwest. 

We would like to take a short course somewhere in southwestern Utah, southern Nevada, or southeastern California. Our goals would be to get comfortable working with quick\-draws and leading single\-pitch sport climbs while working towards setting up belay stations and being able to do multi\-pitch sport climbs.

Would anyone be able to provide recommendations for outfitters or areas to look at doing this. I feel like in this area of the world there is a high risk of getting caught in a tourist trap or in going to the wrong area for us because it is ""famous"".

12,Critique my jumar ascending/self belaying system.,"So, I've set up a self belaying system using a jumar and a grigri, and I would like to hear some critique as I obviously don't want to die. I use this for photographing other climbers.

I essentially belay myself by using a grigri attached as usual in the main loop of my harness, the breaking side of the rope is feeded up through a biner with a pulley, which is attached to a jumar which is fastened to the taught side of the rope. I also have some webbing attached to the jumar so I can step down when I pull the rope through the grigri and the biner. I also have a prussik knot attached to my leg loop, which holds the breaking side of the rope. 

The rope is anchored at the top. If I would use a double stranded rope I would tie in the end which is now tied into the anchor, into my tie in loops of my harness. 

I also carry a lot of webbing and some carabiners to secure myself into bolts on the way up, but this is mainly to hold myself in place while I photograph.

""As a community we need to uphold ourselves to higher standards than permitting defamatory, assaulting behavior. I use my social media platforms to share a window into my life- both professionally and personally, yet I also believe that this channel is a platform to have a voice and stand for what I believe in. This includes spreading more love and taking a stance against bullying. I am hurt and broken hearted to say that I am a victim of a bully and it has crossed the line. 

I write from the hospital, where I sit praying for the health of my family. 
I have received many messages about the ridicule that Joe Kinder has made about me and my career. I have tried reaching out maturely, with no response. I find it incredibly sad that he has chosen this road. Perhaps because I am an independent female who has made a career out of my chosen path that irritates him? 

The second photo in this slide is one example of a reference he has made to me and Edu going to the Verdon, which I had to cancel due to my Grandma’s health. 

At the root of a lot of evil is insecurity. There is a line at which enough is enough, and I do not find it okay that a man can act like such a child, nor target women in such a vulgar way as he has done.

I have chosen to write about this because while joking banter can be light and entertaining, this is not “light” content. This is malicious and ongoing. Behavior like this has dire consequences on the victim, including eating disorders, the perpetuation of gender inequality, and a misrepresentation of the pillars that I am proud that our community stands for.

I’ll be getting a German high school diploma so I’ll be able to go to uni in any of the German-speaking countries (Germany, Austria and Switzerland) but I’ve kind of ruled out Switzerland because of how expensive it is.

1. The city has to have a university, preferably a good one.

2. (More importantly) Easy access to quality bouldering and sport climbing. By easy access I mean &lt;30min for acceptable quality for some weekday sessions and around 1-2 hours for bigger weekend destinations. 

Currently my list is:

- Heidelberg (not so great climbing but great uni so it’s on the list)
- Munich
- Nürnberg/Erlangen
- Freiburg
- Innsbruck
- Vienna

Are there any other places my list is missing? Where would you live in Austria/Germany if you could live anywhere? Any lesser known but still great bouldering or climbing areas in those countries you know of?

I've done alpine trad where you have rappel stations on a tree or horn and you replace the webbing if necessary, but never have done sport multipitch. 

We're going to climb some trad multipitch with bolted anchors this weekend that's a few pitches. Getting up is easy, trad to the anchors, set up a quad, belay from above and swap leads. Rinse and repeat. However, I'm unclear on the best rappel method when a walk off isn't presented. 

My first thought is get to the top of the pitch, set up a quad anchor and tie in with the rope to a locking carabiner, then belay up my second who will PA into the anchor. We are both PA'ed in, we untie, thread the rope through the bolts or rap rings if chains, and perform our rappel where the first rappeler will set up another anchor and rinse and repeat? With that said, what is the best method to secure the ropes when we pull them through the anchor above?

We're both taking a multipitch anchor clinic this weekend before assending our first multipitch, and I will ask the professional guides the same questions, but I wanted the thoughts on the matter. ",climbing,1525068195,Rhezski,0,1,True,2018-04-30

34,Community advice to overcome a fear of falling?,"Thanks for reading.

I’ve been climbing for about a year and a half now, both bouldering and sport, however I mostly bouldered for the first six months.

I can boulder at around V8/9 max, but my sport leading grade is stuck around French 6b+/6c. 
It has been this way for months now, and I’m really starting to get demotivated. I know I should be able to do the moves, but just can’t.

My issue is that I am struggling to commit to even remotely sketchy moves. Any kind of press or even a small dyno are out of the question. 

It’s like I just lock up, and all motivation disappears. In that moment I feel like it’s impossible for me to move further, and from then onwards I just can’t carry on.

I’ve never been able to fully commit to a climb above my onsight grade because of this, and have never fell off the wall whilst trying hard - I always wuss out beforehand.

In the past I have climbed outside and didn’t feel the same as I do indoors, despite much more drawn out routes and fewer bolts - however, I again didn’t try anything above my onsight grade.

I suppose what I’m asking is if anyone else has ever been in a similar situation? And if so, how did you overcome your fear? 

I know there won’t be a miracle cure, but I’m hoping the community insight will give me a few methods to try. 
With any luck, one of them will work!

2,First day!,"Today was my first time going to the climbing gym after it being in the back of my mind for ages. I don't know anyone so I went alone which was kind of intimidating but I had a great time. I have a couple questions/would like advice based on my experience today:

1) What is the typical cost of a monthly/annual membership for climbing gyms you go to? Im in Central CA, the gym is $65 a month or $550 annual

2) I stayed on V0 and V1s but didn't send any today. I would make it about half way up the wall and then get nervous about falling. How do I get over that?

3) My toes hurt (like they were getting blisters) at the end of the hour I was there, is that normal? Did I get a size too small? I have the La Sportiva Tarantula in size 7.5 (W) and my street shoe size is 8 (W). Trying them on they felt tight but good but then climbing in them made my feet hurt.

My hands also started to get sore but I didn't have any chalk today so I assume it'll be better once my hands aren't slippery and they get more tough?

4) The gym has bouldering and top/lead climbing but I only did bouldering today. Should I stick to that until I get comfortable or would it be fine to try my hand at top/lead climbing? Also the great thing for me is that they have employees to belay you so you don't need to bring a friend.

5) How do you attach your chalk bag? Mine didn’t come with a strap and using a carabiner makes it hang farther down than I would like.

This is all the gear I currently have:
Shoes - La Sportiva Tarantula
Harness - BD Momentum
Chalk/Chalk bag

I like to think it goes both ways.

**Dislike**: ""That isn't the right beta."" Honestly, I think this is mostly an issue of phrasing, but it bugs me a little when people act like there's a single correct way to climb a route; it takes a lot of the creativity and individuality out of the process.

For me, the most scared I’ve been was probably climbing a route called son of dawn wall at pinnacles national park. This was a teeth cutting / exposure experience. 6 or so pitched of choss, with half the pitches being very run out / dangerous. Albeit I threw my more experienced friend at those, it was still nerve wracking to have to hang three people off two bolts in crumbly rock. As he was leading a squeeze chimney he started getting spat out and was fairly close to falling with no pro, with nothing but me and the wall behind me to catch his fall, and he was a lot bigger than me. Certainly would’ve crushed me to some degree. After topping out and expecting some relief and a pleasant view, we were welcomed by the unexpected joy of things not being where they were described to be. There was no anchors near by, it was getting dark and we really had no clue what to do. My buddy ended up having to solo this 5.4 exposed ridge line to find any sort of indication that we could make it down. It was a great relief.

But yea overall just some good ole class two shit. My first sport and trad lead were also good but typical stories. This one was so different because it was the tallest feature I’ve climbed with also the sketchiest climbing I’ve done on the loosest rock I’ve been on.

30,Potential 3rd Lumbrical Stain,"I wanted to post this here as someone may be able to offer some insight and guidance as I am going to see a doctor soon. 

I was climbing in my gym this past week trying a new climb with an intricate left hand pinch on a 60 degree overhang. With the pinch, I was able to get my pointer, middle and ring finger on one side, with my thumb on the other side. You use this pinch on the climb to cross over into a 4 finger pocket, so a lot of weight is held by the left pinch. I had tried this route about 5 or 6 times and my ring finger was starting to get sore along the inside length(side close to middle finger) with each consecutive attempt, so I ended up stopping for the day. When I woke up the next morning, in the middle of my left palm, directly under my ring finger is sore. It is not sore all the time, but certian movements of my ring finger (streching it backwards) and clenching into a fist, I can feel soreness in my hand. 

I've done some light research and I think it has something to do with the 3rd lumbrical, however I dont think I tore anything. I never felt a pop or felt a tearing sensation in my finger or palm. Does anyone hanve some insight on what they think could have happened? Or any advice for recovery?

I wanted to ask a question about how to address a local route with a pretty insensitive slur in its name. I'm not trying to start a discussion whether the word is okay to use or not; I don't think it is okay in public names. I'm more interested in finding the best approach to address this issue.

I started climbing outside not too long ago so I'm not too familiar with the history of the area or the people who established it. However, I would like to be part of the community and have made a few group of friends who I climb indoors and outdoors together consistently. Although this particular slur doesn't target me specifically and use of this seems to be an exception than the rule, I'm fairly uncomfortable with it. Especially I worry this reflects badly on the community and potentially drive away others from this fantastic sport.

If I want to address this, what is the best method of approaching it? Author of the guidebook? Local climbing club? FA's?

I could only imagine what would have happened if it were a fall and not a controlled lower.

They fell off and did something that sounded like it hurt a massive amount to their arm. Thankfully they got help very quickly. 

It's great to push yourself, but make sure that if you are doing something risky or that might be out of your skill level, that you understand what might happen if you fall and prepare how you're going to land.

Any ideas as to what causes them?

Proximity to climbing/walking/hiking/other outdoor pursuits is a major factor.

Apologies if this is a common question - I searched but found nothing on this specific ailment.

After a rigorous bouldering session a couple of weeks ago, my left arm is a bit wrecked. It doesn't hurt while resting, but certain movements - raising arms above head or 90 degrees to the side - causes an aching, numbing pain, midway between my elbow and shoulder and travelling up almost to the shoulder itself - basically the area where you'd expect stripes on a uniform.

As far as I can tell, the elbow itself is fine. From what I've read, it sounds similar to climber's elbow, only in a different place.

Any advice on how to treat this would be greatly appreciated. Not climbing is making me pretty twitchy...

77,Climbing hard is fun.,"*stands on soapbox*


I wanted to address something relatively briefly that I think is really common in our community- the accusation that people who are seriously interested in and psyched on climbing hard are ""grade chasing"" or ""doing it for the wrong reasons."" There are many reasons to climb, and one of those is certainly what these opinions allude to; the idea that climbing is a pure, spiritual pursuit that has merit in and of itself. This is especially true relative to outdoor climbing, where so much emphasis is placed on the oneness we get to experience with natural features and resources.

What I think this ignores is the fact that the movement, requisite mental strength, and hard work required to climb into higher grades often represent an extension of the latter emotion, not a contrarian position. The simple fact is, the harder one climbs, the more they can enjoy any given climbing area- they can get on more routes, they can experience more crags and areas, and they can enjoy a greater diversity and range of movement than someone who only climbs casually. I'm not saying it's bad to climb more moderately; there are plenty of crags out there chock full of amazing moderate climbing. I'm also not saying that everyone who pushes themselves, who trains, and who is psyched on climbing hard is doing it for the right reasons. 

What I'm trying to say, and what I'd encourage my fellow climbers to do, is to assume that the person who maybe sprays a little too much about their latest trip to the crag, or who has a hard time not reliving every little detail of beta on their project, is legitimately psyched until they prove otherwise. Give them the benefit of the doubt before assuming the basis of their motivations.

He told me to do some rehabilitation exercises (rice bucket, etc) but it should heal by itself with time and there isn't much I should do about it.

I gave it a rest for almost 6 months and gradually started climbing again. It has been a year now since my injury and I don't feel like I recovered well. My finger gets very sore after climbing and I can't do any hangboarding. 

What worries me the most is that I can still feel significant bow-stringing of my flexor tendon after such a long time. Is that to be expected?

I have been climbing on and off indoors (would climb all the time, but I have rowing 8 practises a week) and for this summer coming up I wanted to climb the many crags and cliffs just 30mins out of town.

Do dry ropes also extend the life of your ropes or do they just protect against wet?

41,Curious about this lead belaying technique,"I'm relatively new to lead climbing and usually belay using the ""shovelling"" method shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqrskjKwTfE

The other day someone showed me a totally different way of belaying which I've never heard of before and can't seem to find online. They said the ""shovelling"" method runs a risk of your hand getting jammed into the first clip if the climber takes a big fall, especially if they're heavier than you. 

So this other technique involved holding the brake-side of the rope with both hands (right hand closest to the gri-gri), and keeping the the rope down and in front of you. As the climber climbs the rope naturally feeds through the device on its own. You pay slack quickly as usual, pressing down on the lever of the gri-gri. And you take up slack similar to how you'd take it up using the standard belay method. If the climber falls, both hands are already on the brake side of the rope.

11,Arcteryx Bora 50L vs Alpha 45L... help me pick my next pack. (xpost from mproject),"Hi All,

I'm in a bit of a unique situation... I sent in my Miura 45 to get repaired at arcteryx and they lost the pack... not too big of a loss for me since I wasn't the biggest fan of it and they're offering me my choice of any pack on their line.

It looks like, for climbing packs, my options are going to be the Alpha 45 or Bora 50.

I was wondering if anyone who has experience with both packs could help me make a decision.

My main uses are sport climbing and multipitch trad climbing. While I'm not regularly going on alpine rock missions, I go on 1 or 2 a summer so something that would suit those needs would be great too.

The alpha looks like it'd suit my needs but I have some concerns about it. It's lightweight so I'm worried about durability(however... apparently if I send it back to arcteryx for repair I maybe get a brand new one haha). I'm also concerned that it wont have separate pocket space for stuff like my knife/wallet/phone/keys/snacks when I'm sport climbing since it looks pretty barebones. What about comfort, I notice the waist straps are pretty barebone, am I going to be pretty uncomfortable if I'm taking this thing on a 5 mile hike to my alpine climb? The bora is an extra 3 pounds but I feel like the extra weight might be made up for by the comfort on longer approaches. However, climbing in the alpha seems like it'd be much easier than the bora... this will be a pretty rare occurrence though for me since i usually bring a small summit pack for mpitch climbs(I'd just be fucked when the descent doesn't pass the base of the climb).

The one thing I really hated about my miura is that I couldn't fit my rope, water, and sport rack in it unless I packed very efficiently... It looks like the alpha has a tie down strap for the rope though so that wont be an issue, right?

Anyways, let's hear the spray! which pack should I get?",climbing,1523400378,BackdoorDan,4,3,True,2018-04-10

16,RRG Trip Report,"Hi guys, I took my first climbing trip the Red last week, and I cannot wait to go back. First things first though, I will warn you that Eastern Kentucky has been colder and wetter than normal this Spring. Because of this, it seems like it's been pretty slow. 

My wife and I left Columbus, OH at noon on Thursday and made it to Lago Linda's Hideaway around 5:30. Solid suggestion, reddit. It's definitely designed solely for climbers, and we met some great ones there. Unfortunately, it's been wet and slow so far this season meaning I was the first person to attempt to pull into the campsite we selected. Let me tell you, the ground was softer than it looked. My 2 wheel drive promptly got stuck. Thankfully, the coolest family from Quebec City came to the rescue before we even realized we needed rescuing! Thank you so much! I apologize for spraying your wife and puppy with mud. I'm also very sorry for breaking your tow rope 3 times. If any of you know someone fitting this description, DM the address of his gym so I can send a new tow rope. 

Once we were back on gravel, we started to make camp as their were thunderstorms in the forecast for that night and my wife likes some level of comfort. While inflating the air mattress, we realized it was bigger than the footprint of my tent. After getting stuck and covering my own wife with mud, we decided it was best to stay at my parent's place an hour and 20 minutes north of the gorge. 

Before though, we stopped by SkyBridge Station to see if they had a rain check policy for the next day as we had booked their guide service and saw an 80% chance of rain for Tuesday. (Sidenote: go there and get a quesadilla. They pack those suckers with chicken. It might have been the most protein packed quesadilla I've ever had.) I was very unfamiliar with the Red and learned that it's totally climb-able in the rain if you go to Muir Valley. Our guide was cool and patient with all the n00b questions I had and told us he'd see us in the morning. 

We got there Tuesday about 20 minutes early and filled out all the releases. This is a first for me in outdoor tourism, but our guide was ready to go before our scheduled time. The professionalism was much appreciated. So we hopped in the truck and headed to the krag. Some fun off road driving and a short hike to the wall. It was cool to be the first ones there that morning. Again, our guide, Erik, wanted us to get the most bang for our buck and didn't waste time. 

He taught me how to use a stick-clip and then led the sport route. It was my first time belaying lead so it was cool to learn. Obviously, he could free-solo these easy &lt;5.7 routes if he desired, but I appreciate his commitment to safety and him using this as an opportunity to teach me. Since it was our first time climbing outside, he set it up as top rope which was cool with me. I'd like to learn to lead climb, but I was just happy to be outside for the first time. 

We ended up doing 5 routes in the 4 hours we'd booked which seemed like a lot to me. Contrary to indoor climbing, my arms didn't get pumped, but I felt like my hand were starting to shred. 

Erik was a total pro and had top notch safety protocol. He even took the time to teach other climbers safety mistakes they were making. I would recommend Kentucky Rock and Adventure Guides to anyone of any climbing ability. They really knew their stuff and had great professionalism. 

After a day of climbing, we made the pilgrimage to Miguel's and order a pizza and Ale 8. It ended up being ok but had a bit of a wait. Maybe it was Spring Break traffic because it seemed so busy for a Tuesday afternoon. I'd say it's cool to see, but not great pizza. As a more seasoned paddler, Pies N Pints was way better. 

With that, we were on our way out of town. It was a super short trip, and I'm already planning to go back as soon as possible. 

For real though, if you know the guy from Quebec City with his family there last week, DM me his address so I can send him a tow rope and proper thank you! ",climbing,1523408770,brokenshoulders,16,1,True,2018-04-10

24,Diagnosing a finger injury..,"I hope this is the right place to ask but I'm having a tough time finding anyone that's had a similar injury and I'm hoping anyone here may be able to help me out.

The injury is present in my middle knuckle, middle finger on my left hand, on the top (I believe it's the extensor tendon?). I noticed a ache after climbing a few weeks ago, and on closer inspection noticed that the top of the finger almost seemed to 'crunch' or 'pop' when I bent it. Doing it once isn't sore but after a few times is slightly painful.

Obviously I stopped doing it, and have put it in a splint, which has reduced the number of 'pop's to 1 big pop instead of 3 or 4 smaller pops. When i take it out the splint it's quite sore until I've stretched it out a little, and slightly resistant to bending initially. 

I went to the doctor, who didn't really seem to give it much thought, advised me not to splint it and has given me Naproxen.

Has anyone had something similar? I've given climbing a rest for 2 weeks now and it's getting quite frustrating having no idea when it'll be sensible to go again.. NHS warnings go up to 3 months off which sounds a bit gutting over what feels like quite a minor injury.

28,REI harness return question... (kind of a morals issue :/ ),"So I bought a climbing harness at REI in early January, used it less than half a dozen times and realized I really didn't like the fit, but I figured since I hadn't used it that much it would be ok to return it. So I went in Feb 1st and returned/exchanged it for a different one that I thought fit me pretty well [\(For reference, this is what I got\)](https://www.rei.com/product/899117/black-diamond-solution-harnesss-womens). But recently I realized I had the waist belt way too high, it was sitting more on my stomach than on my hips. Well now I have it sitting on my hip bones and its a lot more comfortable/secure, but I feel like the leg loops might be sitting a bit to low on my thighs and they just hang loosely on/around my thighs. I think part of that is because when I was looking at the harness a medium fit me really well once I had it on, but I couldn't get it on without having to undo the strap on the waist, so I decided to get the large instead so I wouldn't have to do that every time. Which also means that I only have about an inch\-two inches of strap left for tightening it more \(granted I don't know if my hips will get smaller/bigger/just stay the same now that I'm loosing weight/getting more fit and still going through changes from HRT\).

Bit of background: I'm a transwoman and was/am still a little bit paranoid about some things when it comes to gendered stuff, so I only tried on women's harnesses and put the waist belt up higher to match the pictures I've seen of women wearing harnesses 😬 \(and yes I do realize how dumb that sounds but being trans and wanting to pass can make you do a lot of dumb shit like this\) 

So to get to my actual question:

Now that I have used it more, around 20\-25 times at the gym, would it be wrong to return it and get a different harness that would possibly fit a little better? ",climbing,1523456357,spikerbond,35,1,True,2018-04-11

45,"Ego, incompetence, and gym climbing","I'll try my best to remove judgments and opinions I have about the popularity of climbing in recent years and gym climbing being grouped in with climbing in general. Though I suppose that statement in itself perhaps suggests how I feel about it all. 


I have been actively climbing, mostly outdoors, for nearly 15 years now. Primarily multi pitch trad. The past few years I have also been climbing a lot in a gym, averaging at least twice a week. Lead certified and all that. 


Today, I had someone come up to me in the gym and state my belaying was making her nervous. I asked why. The reason was that I didn't have a hand on the break at all times. I stated, ok but can you not see that my left hand is securing the brake before I move my right hand up when pulling slack; is the problem really that I am using my left hand or is it that I moved my right hand above the left rather than grab high with the left and slide up the right? 

Now, aside from the above statement to her, I didn't try to rationalize or talk about it, I said I get it, it's a gym there are rules, I'll just be more mindful to slide my right hand up from now on, not let it totally come off. 

But....

In both cases, there is a hand on the break at all times, sometimes if I am pulling up a lot of slack quickly it is simpler to move the right hand above the left, rather than keep my right hand low, grab with the left and slide the right. I am without a doubt not the only person doing this while belaying a top roping climber, with a gri gri (or even an atc for that matter). Also in both cases the right hand temporarily is off of the brake, though in the method of keeping your right hand low and sliding it would be easier to regrab the rope in case of a fall that also resulted in a grigri failure. I totally get that, and I totally get why they prefer you to do that. However, when you are quickly pulling rope up for a taller climbing making big moves in the gym, well within their range of ability, I find that there is no legitimate risk to moving your hand right hand up above the left, so long as the left hand is secure on the rope. 

The issue that I have is her saying that my other way was making her nervous. To me, admittedly stated with my own bit of ego, that 'nervousness' suggests a serious level of incompetence on her part. What I was doing is not the preferred method, I know, but it is by no means unsafe in that situation. 

Here is the other kicker for me and what I think may really be peeving me: she claimed she worked at the gym, but I go there a lot, at a variety of times thru the day and week (am unemployed-ish) and have never seen her working there. In fact, she didn't come to nag me from behind the counter, and after approaching and leaving me she left and went up to the yoga class, and I then didn't see her again until after. I'm pretty sure that if she does actually work there, she just pretends to wrangle all the daycare children they let run loose around there. Which, in my egoist opinion is far more unsafe than my belaying. Also, why just come up to me and not the other hoards of people doing the same thing. I looked around, and I looked at the people I know are old alpinists, because yes I do trust their judgement and style better. They were doing the same thing as me.  

So maybe this is just a rant, and maybe that is what this could devolve into, a place to air grievances and then set each other straight if need be. Tell me I'm an unsafe, arrogant traditionalist; that is fine, or better yet, tell me why I am being unsafe with legitimate reasons and teach me something.

48,Harness for women with large thighs.,"Hello everyone, I'm struggling with my harness sizing because I'm not built like the general female climber/mountaineer. I currently have a medium black diamond momentum harness that I have used in the past year on a couple mountaineering trips and indoor climbing. My major issue with it is it gets uncomfortable because it cuts into my thighs. I have pretty large thighs genetically and I spend a lot of time playing and lifting to train for ultimate frisbee. When I bought my harness I tried on a large which fit my thighs but I was not able to tighten it enough on my waist for it to act as a safety device. What other brands would any of you suggest I try out? Black Diamond is really the only brand I know enough to trust.

Thanks!

    What is your maximum climbing grade?

    Do you currently partake in any form of strength training, whether to improve your climbing or for another goal?

    If no, have you have participated in any strength training,

    If yes to 6, for how long?

I was wondering if anyone had a positive result, if only a small one, with getting their shoes a little tighter, and I understand these are synthetic so I won't get any massive shrinking.

My ultimate plan is to put some 4mm sensitive rubber on them in the next resole and request that the cobbler/resoler does their best to shrink them down a bit but the rubber is just too fresh to justify resoling them already.

I’m in college currently and taking a speech class, one of my speeches is an informative topic. I am choosing to inform my class about rock climbing and how despite the high risk activity that it is, that the equipment and community of climbers remain relatively safe. Of course I need some citations so I was wondering if anyone knew of some good literature that exists to back up my argument.

I hope that my text above is clear, if not I’d be happy to answer any questions.

42,Scarpa VS Instinct Sizing,"I've been trying to look for my first pair of more ""aggressive"" climbing shoes after having worn holes into my tarantulas. I really liked the scarpa instinct for its heel but I can't decide between how ""aggressive"" (read: painful) they should be. I'm usually a size 9 women's, 39-40 EU sizes and I tried on 40.5 and 41 for the Scarpa Instinct VS (Velcro) and I was pretty much dying for the 40.5, tolerable pain for the 41. The 40.5 fit really nicely in the heel but the knuckle on my big toe was killer and I don't think it'll stretch much given the rubber on top. The 41 definitely had dead space in the heel and my smaller toes. If it makes a difference,I have fairly wide feet.

I'm mostly just asking this because it seemed most people sized at least 2 EU sizes down so I'm concerned that they'll become too loose. For reference, I had a 39.5 in my tarantulas (the green velcro ones), but did notice they become much looser after the break-in period so I probably could have gone half a size smaller initially.

Also, did anyone notice a sizing difference between the velcro and the lace Instincts VS? I read the lace fit slightly tighter and only managed to try the 41 in the lace, not the Velcro but the lady at the store said the fit should be similar.

It seems to me like unless you have someone like this in your life, your options are to either

(a) utilize online resources to find an experienced climber who for some reason wants to spend their time teaching a beginner for free, or 

(b) pay lots of money to take lessons until you become good enough to go without an instructor, at which point you would probably utilize online resources to find people to climb with. Those people would probably be at or below your level and you wouldn't be able to learn as much from them (though I do understand that every session is an opportunity to practice and gain experience). And even if you do find people, there's the problem of flakiness (simply meaning that people have priorities other than helping a stranger they met online get better at climbing).

I've hit a bit of a plateau with my climbing. I've been going to my local gym like 4 times a week (sometimes more sometimes less depending on how busy school is) and I feel like I'm getting a little burned out. A few months ago my friend that I usually climb with has stopped climbing so I've been going to the gym alone for the most part. I still love climbing but I start to get bored and will usually go home before I get that good pumped-out feeling.

I think some sort of a training plan that will help me reach a goal would be good for me to get motivation back but I don't really know where to go to create one. Does anyone have any suggestions of how to make a good plan? It doesn't need to be super thorough, just something a little bit structured to help me get back on track.

On top rope I'm easily comfortable with any route in the 5.10s, can do most 5.11s, and sent my first 5.12 a few months ago. Ideally I want to train for top rope but without my climbing buddy I don't get to do that often, so its usually the bouldering wall for me (V4s, V5s, and V6s if I'm feeling good).

75,Question About Sore Shoulder,"Hello climbers. 

I'm relatively new to climbing. I've been climbing top-rope in the gym for about a year and I'm slowly getting better. When I started I could barely hang on long enough to make it to the top of a 5-7. Now, I regularly struggle to the top of 5-10's whenever I go to the gym. 

Since I upped the intensity, for about two months now, my right shoulder has been really sore. It kind of pops every now and then (not while I'm climbing but during everyday activities) and it's hard to sleep on. It's not enough pain to keep me from climbing. In fact, climbing usually alleviates the pain.

A couple of weeks ago, I went down to Red Rocks with a couple of friends. A friend of mine had scored a crazy deal from BD and got an ATC Pilot for super cheap and insisted that everyone use it at least once over the course of the trip. I was intrigued by the idea of the pilot, but never considered buying one, because I already have two other ATCs and don't need a third. With that being said, the Pilot is actually a pretty nifty single pitch cragging belay device. Once you get past the plastic build and the kind of clunky design, you realize that it handles the rope really well. It makes it really easy to feed rope and lower your climber. After 4 days of use, you could barely see any wear on the device--which was pretty surprising. 

All in all, I was pretty surprised with it. If you're strictly climbing single pitch and not doing very much rappelling, this device is great for that and just that. I had fun using it, but probably wont get one.",climbing,1522799687,mennatm,30,16,True,2018-04-03
69,Today I had the best feeling I've had in climbing.,"I work as a climbing instructor.  A few months ago I was working a party for kids mostly aged around 7.  There was also a girl aged around 11 on my group who I'll call Jade.  She was really scared of heights and at first wouldn't get more than a metre off the floor.  Despite the fact that the birthday girl was in my group I spent most of my time encouraging and helping Jade.

By the end of the party she was climbing noticeably higher but was quite upset.  The younger girls were all getting to the top really easily but she was too scared to climb past a quarter of the way up.  I always feel sad to see someone has had a bad time climbing because they find it too hard or scary.  It was heartbreaking to see a kid feel inferior because of something as natural as a fear of heights.  I gave all the encouragement I could.  I could tell it helped a bit she was still upset and lacking in confidence.

Fast forward to today.  I had a 1 hour session for 2 kids just before I finished and it turns out it's for Jade and her brother.  I was so happy to see her because she never gave up and that's my favorite quality in a person.  I was also stoked to find out Jade and her brother had both come yesterday and Jade and gotten 2 thirds of the way up the wall.

Learning this I was quietly hopeful Jade would get to the top but she started off being too scared to climb even half way again.  However as the session went on she got better and better until she got one move past her previous high point before coming down.  Determined to get to the top she had another go.  She got to her new high point and with a bit of guidance and encouragement she made the next move.  From here on in all the moves were small and she didn't even stop on her way to the chains.

Seldom have I seen someone as happy and as proud as Jade was on making it to the top.  She had to fight so hard for it she was brought to tears a few times but she would always have another go.  When she got down to the ground her worry had been replaced with boundless psych.  She was so excited to get to the top again.  And she did.  She got the route clean.  It was like something had clicked inside her and she had discovered that she could do it, she could climb.  The confidence boost was phenomenal.  Until this point she didn't really believe she was good enough to do it.  I think she thought me and the other instructors just said that to make her feel better.  But all off a sudden she saw how good she really was.

Being a part of Jade of that is honestly the best feeling I've ever had climbing.  Better than climbing my first 7a, which for a long time was a grade I thought only superheros climbed.  Better than overcoming my own fear of heights and climbing a trad route at a grade I used to think was terrifyingly hard.  Better than the multipitch's I've done with best friends where we got to see the sun set over the Med.

Not only did I help her discover the beauty of climbing but I helped give her a huge confidence boost and the wonderful feeling of conquering a fear.  I hope she remembers today for a long time.  Not just for the climbing but as an example of how she can overcome anything if she puts her mind to it.  What an amazing kid.

TL;DR - Helped a kid who was low on confidence and terrified of heights make it to the top of her first climb and made her very happy.",climbing,1522800897,IceFieldsOfHyperion,15,133,True,2018-04-03
70,Layering Recommendations [x-post from /r/alpinism],"I do most of my climbing/mountaineering/hiking in Colorado. I've been using a synthetic base layer, R1 fleece hoodie, superthin OR Ferrosi hoodie as my main layers. I've got an old school Patagonia belay parka I use for belaying and cold/stormy weather, and an REI shell I use when it gets wet. Depending on the trip, I'll bring the parka, the shell, or both in my pack. 

I've been considering a new solution. I've gotten cold/wet on a couple trips this year, and need something a little heavier duty. What do you recommend? I like the baselayer and R1 part of the equation, but I think I need a sturdier softshell, and maybe a warmer belay parka. I was looking at the Arc'teryx Atom AR. It seems like it would be a MUCH warmer softshell layer, and would negate the need for a warmer belay parka than what I have now.

A friend of mine with a similar level of experience just got 5 cams (.5-3 camalots) and 5 nuts (dmm offsets) so the other day we went to rumbling bald in NC and did some mixed routes where we practiced placing gear but with the safety of there being bolts to clip too. From cleaning gear as a follower and watching a lot of videos, choosing the right cam and placing it solidly was pretty easy for me. Nuts were pretty straightforward as well and the placements looked the same as the pieces I've cleaned and they felt super bomber. I have the ability to set up on a bolted anchor after leading a pitch and belay a follower with either a redirect or atc guide, and I've done plenty of rappelling. Would you guys say it's a terrible idea for my partner and I to keep doing mixed climbs (below our ability) and eventually transition to full trad routes once we get more gear and experience placing it?

34,"Checked out Cathedral Domain, new area in the Red - initial thoughts","There isn't much info available on this spot, so I thought it would be a service to the community to share a little from my experience.  

My partner and I went down yesterday morning.  There were no other cars in the lot when we arrived (~12 PM).  Parking is usually $10 but the sign advertised a discounted $5 rate for Spring 2018.  There were waivers, maps, and lists of climbs, all printouts of the same info available [online](http://www.cathedraldomain.org/rock-domain).  

As it's a new area and we aren't crushers, we went with [East Coast Crag](https://i.imgur.com/rEzCOEo.png) to try the super-moderates.  The crag says ""Access from Thieves Run Trail off Durban Loop"", neither of which are on the trail map.  Some info at the kiosk mentioned it being off of Outer Mesa trail, which was also not marked, but we set out toward Mesa and eventually started seeing signage.  The approach was fairly burly, with a lot of up-and-down on steep (though only somewhat muddy) trails.  I'd compare it to hiking from Land Before Time to Tectonic Wall in Miur.  

I'd never climbed a new/chossy area before, and after the first few holds/feet blew on me, it was a real struggle in places to commit to moves.  There were two climbs in a slabby/balancy style that I'm not experienced with, which seemed to require really specific beta to meet the grade.  Humbling, to say the least.  I think if I return to Cathedral Domain any time soon I might stick clip up and TR anything first before going for the redpoint, if only to save on getting as banged up trying to figure out on the sharp end what will hold and what won't. For what it's worth, I didn't see anything that gave the impression a dangerously-large block was ready to dislodge on me, but I was definitely glad to have brought a helmet.

I'm also curious to see how the grades might change over time - there is a route currently marked 5.5 that was harder than either 5.8 or 5.8+ and pretty sketchy-feeling as well, though it was more or less hands-free rests between each move.

The anchors are perma-draws, which makes cleaning a breeze, though the bolt hangers are these [Mad Rock](http://www.sunnysports.com/Image/Product/Large/MDRSH.jpg) designs with a sort of thick stamped edge on the inside that liked to catch the draw when clipping and made me appreciate how spoiled I am by titanium glue-ins.

All in all, the area shows a lot of promise.  I'd be interested to check out some of the other crags that have perhaps been further developed, and it will be interesting to see how things shake out once more people try the area and post to Mountain Project, etc as there is really just not much info available currently.",climbing,1522609316,Tim_Theory,6,16,True,2018-04-01

I'm a diabetic, so I size my shoes to be fitting, bit not tight. 

I think I have it narrowed down to the Vapor V (43.5) and Otaki (42). I like that they both have generous room in the toe box. The only think that's stopping me from the Vapors is that the rubber patch on the toes rubs on my big toe knuckles kind of funny. And I'm not sure how the synthetic breaks in. Otherwise they are insanely comfortable out of the box. The Otakis seem to fit well, but seem super aggressive and the upper material seems very stiff. I like that they're is no super thick toe patch, which allows for a bit of give. I feel like the shoes might be too aggressive for my skill level (5.9-10+). I just have no idea how they will break in.

15,"How to be a professional ""dirtbag""?","I am a Software Engineer working 40-50 hours a week (it varies). I am also a climber and have been for about a decade. I like the work I do and it is fulfilling and it pays well. It is also very stressful at times. I am currently in a situation where I am freaking out about the idea of working in an office build for 8+ hours a day for the rest of my life. 

I only get to climb on the weekends and I can only go on climbs that have me home by Sunday. I love climbing, it gives my life so much meaning and joy. The adventures and camaraderie and just going out there and living, I can't get enough. I sit at work looking at new routes, listening to climbing podcasts, and dreaming about being back in the alpine. I want to climb ALL THE TIME. 

Sorry, if I have been rambling. Let me cut to the chase. I want to maximize my time climbing (multi-day climbs, trips to climb in other countries, etc),  but all that requires money and I am certainly not good enough to be sponsored by anyone, but myself. Being a software engineer does lend the possibility of working remotely or just picking up projects when I need the cash flow. I am not looking to dirtbag it by living in a van or such. I want a home base. 

For those of you who have figured out how to have a professional career and get away for week(s) at a time to climb, how did you do it and what career do you have? I would consider a career change. 

Thank you for reading this and I look forward to hearing your responses.

25,Scarpa Vapor V sizing and heel rand pain,"Hi guys. So I just bought my second pair of climbing shoes, the Vapors. I wear 45-45.5 in street shoes and the first climbing pair I got is a 44.5 Mythos. After climbing in them for a few months they did stretch and while I can definitely still climb well in them, sometimes they feel a tad too large, especially at the heel. 

After trying some sizes, I also got the Vapors in 44.5, I,m leaning a bit towards comfort,. especially now that the shoes are not what is keeping me from upping my grade. They are definitely snugger than the mythos. They feel fine, a bit hard on my pinky knuckles (I have quite a wide foot) but what bothers me is the heel rand (bear in mind I didn't climb in them yet, since if I do that I don't think I'll be able to exchange them). When I put them on all is fine, however when I get up they are straight murdering my achilles tendon.

The two anchor bolts were very uneven, separated by 1-1.5 feet. The chain on the higher bolt was extended so that the rap rings were at equal height, but I wasn't sure how to equalize my draws. Then I saw that there was a second, shorter chain coming off the higher bolt that ended at the same height as the lower anchor bolt. I've been told never to clip draws to chains, but in this case it would have been difficult to get a draw through the higher bolt because of the double chains and it seemed like the second chain had no other purpose but to act as an extender for draws. I ended up putting draws on the lower bolt and the short chain, but when I got down and told my partner what the situation was she said I shouldn't have clipped the short chain.

I will be in Sofia in Bulgaria from the sixth till the eleventh of June. I will be visiting the WICS for work-related reasons, but if I'm visiting the country I'd also like to get some climbing in, if possible.

2) Any people in Bulgaria that would like to meet in a climbing gym after working hours somewhere (possible several times) 6-9 June?

I have a question for the experienced ones:

9 out of 10 times when I have to rappel I will use an extended rappel, usually with a double length sling girth hitched on my tie in points and my ATC on the loop created by an overhand. You know how it is.

Thing is,  I was reading about techniques for passing a knot during rappels, but all of them seems to explain the technique assuming you are using your device ON your belay loop, the traditional old school way.  I am having a hard time trying to find any kind of information regarding  a way to do it while using the extended rappel rig. Any idea why ?

Before I started climbing I did Candito's 6 Week strength and loved it, but that and climbing 2 to 3 times a week was just too much with everything else I have going on.
Current stats: 6'3'' 180 pounds 330 deadlift (was 420 pre knee tweak, but I have been gaining that weight back at a rate o about 30 pounds a week so I will be there again soon), 240 squat (305 pre knee tweak), 195 bench, pull up with +90 pounds, climbing V4, projecting V5 with around 6 or 7 months experience

**Monday:** Hard climbing/ projecting day Warm up 5 or so easy problems to get in the groove 5 or so problems around my V level, but ones that I have completed already 30 to 45 minutes projecting 30 to 45 minutes trying new routes that are slightly harder than my current level (V4 projecting v5's)

**Tuesday:** Lower body 1 Warm up High Bar Squat: 4 x 6 Deadlift: 4 x 6 Single Leg Leg Press: 4 x 12 each side Seated Calf: 4 x 6 Hanging Leg Raises 3 x 15 each side Plank one minute each side Restorative Yoga 15-30 mins

**Wednesday:** Upper day 1 Warm up Bench 4 x 6 Weighted Pull ups (standard, neutral, supinated) 4 x 6 Dips 4 x 12 (These are new to me so I am not doing them weighted yet) Barbel Bent row 4 x 6 Heavy Finger Rolls 4 x 6 If energy allows I do one optional exercise, where I work a weak spot, typically I will do reverse curls, or reverse flies Hanging Leg Raises 3 x 15 (each side) Restorative Yoga 15-30 minutes

**Thursday:** Climbing Endurance and Tech day Warm up 5 or so easy problems to get in the climbing mindset 5 or so problems that are just below my level, but I also downclimb them slowly and statically 4 sets of 4x4s Roof work, mainly foot placement based 30 minutes free climbing

**Friday:** Lower day 2 Squat 4 x 6 Stiff leg DL 4 x 12 Hip Add/Abductor Machine 4 x 12 Standing Calf Raises 4 x 12 Abs Circuit Restorative Yoga

**Saturday:** Upper day 2 Bench 4 x 6 Weighted Pull ups 4 x 6 Dips 4 x 12 One Arm Cable Row 4 x 6 Standing Lat Pull down 4 x 6 Arnold Press 4 x 12 (light) hanging leg raises 3 x 15 Restorative Yoga 15 -30 mins Sunday: Day off, but I still do the yoga

My main concern here is the 6 day on 1 day off cycle. I have done it in the past with a PPL program, but this seems a bit more intensive, and unfortunately there is nothing I really want to give up in this routine. Feel free to pick this apart, maybe I am doing everything wrong and shoudl start from scratch on my routine, don't be afraid to hurt my feelings. I want to craft the most ideal routine for my odd situation.

Aside from that, how does my routine look in terms of push pull balance, upper vs lower balance. Is anything being neglected?

19,Thoughts on half rope impact force vs single rope impact force...,"People will sometimes claim that half ropes have less impact force on pro than single ropes.  This could be true, but it’s because: 

1) The way half ropes are used allow a straighter line and for more active rope to be available to absorb the energy of a fall and 

2) It’s assumed that the load will come on one strand but will then be shared by the second strand at a lower piece.

Here’s some reasoning: 

The UIAA 1.77 factor test standards are very severe and almost impossible to duplicate in the field. However, they provide reassurance and a good comparison. The maximum impact forces are as follows:

* For single ropes : 12kn tested with an 80kg mass single strand. Must survive 5 falls

* For twin ropes:  12kn with an 80kg mass both strands. Must survive 12 falls

* For half ropes:  8kn with a 55kg mass single strand. Must survive 5 falls

*OK, so why an 80kg mass when climbers and gear weigh more than that?*

Because, unlike a solid steel mass,  humans are squishy and arms and legs flail about so the impact does not occur all at once. It was determined that a solid 80kg mass was equal to a  larger squishy human mass.

Since twin ropes are always clipped together into each piece, the test is the same as for single ropes

*How come the test for half ropes uses a 55kg mass and 8kn impact force?*

Half ropes are intended to be clipped singly into alternate pieces of pro.  The load is intended to start on one strand but would likely be shared by the other strand.  Also, the test is to help us compare ropes. Now, one strand of half rope WILL survive a UIAA test fall with a 80kg mass. But, it won’t survive too many of them. So, it’s difficult to differentiate between two different manufacturer’s ropes with such a small sample of falls.  If you were comparing two different half ropes and they both survived 2 test falls with an 80kg mass, you’d think they were equal,  right? But, that might not be the case.  A test on a single strand with a 55kg mass might show that one rope survives 5 falls and a different rope survives 7 - even though the same ropes may have both broken at 3 falls with an 80kg mass.  The 55kg test allows a larger sample of falls and it becomes easier to compare.

It’s true that many half ropes are also rated as twins. In that case, they have been tested both with an 80kg mass  on two strands and a 55kg mass on a single strand.

So, let’s look at a comparison of impact forces from the UIAA 80kg mass tests on single strands of half rope verses the same test on single ropes:

Half ropes:

* Petzl Tango 8.5mm:  9.2kN 

* Petzl Salsa 8.2mm: 9kN 

* Petzl Paso 7.7mm: 8.5KN 

* Beal Joker 9.1mm: 8.2kN

Single ropes

* Mammut Eternity 9.8mm: 8.5 kN

* Petzl Mambo 10.1mm: 8.5kN

* Petzl  Contact 9.8mm: 8.4kN

* Beal Joker 9.1mm: 8.2kN

Pretty similar, right?

So should I go through the official facility’s belay orientation with her?

The narrator expresses doubts about the trip, saying how he was recently married and that he can't wait to go back home to his wife.

All of a sudden, a lady started screaming ""My finger! My finger"" almost hysterically. She was on the other side of this feature so I wasn't able to see what happened. I assumed she took an awkward whipper and broke a finger.
A few minutes pass and she is still screaming. No one in the gym is climbing anymore at this point. First aid is being administered and I'm still not 100% sure what's going on until I see someone walking towards the entrance with a blue ice pack and an entire finger just sitting on top.. knuckle to nail and something hanging off about 3 inches long, what I assume to be the tendon.
Has anyone seen this happen before? It would take a lot force to rip off an entire finger, I don't think it was from a hold or a pocket. The only possible scenario I can think of is that she had her finger in a hanger and took a bad fall. This might be a good reminder to not use hangers as holds or to put your finger through one while climbing.

We are going to Canada in July to do some hiking, mountain biking, and of course climbing. We have about 2 weeks to spend on the climbing part and we want to go to Squamish, which looks amazing. So few questions:

1. One of us leads trad up to 17 at home (~5.9 - although I heard you guys have older 5.9s that can be sandbagged). The other one is not a confident trad leader but likes to second and lead sport up to 21 (~5.10d). Will there be plenty for us to do in Squamish? Given that it's a different rock type to home (sandy sandstone and not much real crack climbing) and we might need to downgrade ourselves while we learn.

2. What sort of rack is good for Squamish? Obviously it depends on objective, but in general. We only have a basic rack at the moment but are happy to upgrade/borrow/hire gear.

3. Are there other areas in BC we should check out? The Bugaboos look amazing but we are not experienced for anything involving snow. I'm thinking stuff like a small local crag where we can spend a day or two camped next to a pretty lake. Or somewhere where the weather is often good when Squamish weather is bad. Of course I imagine we'll meet climbers at Squamish to ask, but might as well gather some ideas.

I’m kind of freaking out. They test those regularly. I used them all the time, and every time I let go I always had a split moment of “is this the day I die? No, no, that’s silly, these are safe”. I always planned to have my son start using them when he’s a little older. Now, I don’t think I’ll ever trust an auto-belay device again.

I don’t think this was the gym’s fault in any way, like I said they test the auto-belays regularly. They posted on Facebook once things calmed down at the gym to let everyone know there had been an accident and that the auto-belays are off limits indefinitely until further notice, and there is going to be an investigation.

27,"Let's talk about our ""near miss"" stories","I was inspired by the recent thread about an autobelay fall (https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/8687c1/autobelay_device_broke_at_my_local_gym_and/) where climbers were discussing human versus mechanical factors as a cause of the accident.

Whatever the case in that particular accident, **human factors (aka mistakes) are the most common cause of climbing accidents.** Any quick read through Accidents in North American Mountaineering will verify that.

I wanted to share my own near-miss story and encourage others to share theirs as a reminder that not only is climbing dangerous, but we are own worst enemy (and best defense) against accidents. For background: I've been climbing for 8 years and climb mid 12 on sport and 10+/11- on trad. I've climbed hundreds of pitches (if not over a thousand) of multipitch trad as well as sport, mixed/alpine climbing and mountaineering. I consider myself very familiar with a variety of rope systems and overall a safe climber.

In December 2017, I was climbing a route called in NC, USA called the Original Route (https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105965582/original-route-aka-gom-jabber). We were climbing in a team of 3 on half ropes - myself, R (my longest standing climbing partner with whom I've climbed hundreds of trad pitches) and another friend of ours, A. I led most of the route but A wanted to lead the 5th pitch, so we swapped leads for that pitch. I took back over to lead pitch 6 which was not hard (5.8+) but was an awkward, insecure slab dihedral. I racked up, verified I was on belay, unclipped and set off. 

About 15 feet off  the anchors, I placed a bomber 0.75 and clipped one of my strands in before committing to the awkward crux moves. I started into the crux and had trouble figuring out the beta, so I backed off to a stance. I looked down at my harness and realized... I'd never tied in with my second rope after we swapped leads. I had a figure 8 tied and threaded through my hard points (Lynn Hill style) but not finished. Had I fallen, I was looking at a 40 foot factor two swinging fall onto the anchor (since I had only clipped that strand into my piece).

I try to be an ""annoyingly safe"" climber - if very experienced friends in the gym start off without a visual inspection, I yell out, ""check your knot, since I didn't."" Yet even though checking knots is an integral part of a basic belay safety check, it wasn't part of my usual check mid-multipitch. I was so used to tying in at the bottom and untying at the top on multi routes that while I checked the anchor, my partner's belay and my redirect through the anchor, I never bothered to check that I was actually tied into the rope.

The point of this is that **mistakes happen and they kill/seriously injure climbers, even experienced climbers.** Maintaining vigilance is hugely important to keeping yourself safe, and recognizing that you (and your partner) are both the weakest and strongest part of the system -- not your 'biners, not your rope, and not (usually) your gear -- will help keep you safe.

I'd encourage others to share their near-miss (or actual miss) stories to help remind all of us (irrespective of experience) to be careful. If it can happen to Lynn Hill, it can certainly happen to any of us. ",climbing,1521721546,sanityonleave,77,46,True,2018-03-22

So I know there was a lot of speculation about user error being the cause of the fall... turns out that was not the case. There's a French [article about it](https://www.lereflet.qc.ca/sommes-choc-proprietaire-canyon-escalade/), here is a basic summary:

- the auto-belay cable broke and that is what caused the fall
- he fell 15 meters (50 feet)
- there were some EMTs on site climbing when the fall happened (they are regulars, I've seen them there often in the mornings) who took charge of the situation while employees called 911
- all 4 auto-belays on site were last inspected in February and passed inspection
- auto-belays at this gym are now off limits for the time being
- an investigation is underway and the gym is bringing in a psychologist to talk to the employees
- the climber was a 16 year old boy and badly injured both legs

For those who are curious, [this is what the auto-belays are clipped into at the bottom](https://i.imgur.com/rkD0lXC.jpg) and this is [what the tops look like](https://i.imgur.com/sNqCINW.jpg).

43,FiveTen Blancos suitable for indoor bouldering?,"I currently wear FiveTen Pinks which I've had for about five months (my second pair of shoes), I'm looking to get a new pair of shoes as I've worn holes in the front of the toes on the pinks, I think by dragging the front of the boot down the wall as I downclimb. The soles are also so soft that I get a lot of pain whenever I try to use the outside edge of the boot. 
I'm looking at the blancos because I know the pinks are a comfortable fit, and I don't want to lose the edging ability and the sole should be more durable, but people have said the Blancos are better suited to trad or sport as I need softer and more sensitive shoes for bouldering. 
Basically does anyone know how the blancos compare with regards to toe sensitivity (obviously the rubber is thicker but idk how much of a difference this will make)? And also if there's any difference in the heel of the blancos (I find the heel a little too loose for aggresive hooking with the pinks).

46,Best Stick Clip Combo - No Contest,"This Pole: [Wooster 4' - 8' or 6' - 12' Sherlock Extension Pole](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Wooster-4-ft-8-ft-Sherlock-Extension-Pole-00R0550000/100187725)

With this Clip:  [SuperClip](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00YW5UOSM/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ABCZC6E318UCC&amp;psc=1)

I have been climbing down at the RRG (Red River Gorge) for a while now where cruxes can be low, bolts can be high and overhands are familiar. Any pole extender with a twist locking mechanism fails over time since a lot of force is generated when pulling the clip off the draw. Wooster style clip clocking poles can handle this force much better. 

The SuperClip has a good set of tricks for clipping and unclipping draws. See all the different ways here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23iJzIb8ucM

The 4' - 8' is a good medium length that with your height gets you to about 16' +/- of total reach which I would say is roughly 80-90% of the first hangers at The Red and many other sport crags around the US. I would say its pretty rare to have to a draw further than that, and if it is further, it is usually relaxed climbing up to it. Consider the 6' - 12' to reach everything else the 4' - 8' can't reach (pretty rare) or if you are shorter. Note that the 6' doesn't pack up as nicely as the 4' since the 4' can go perpendicular to a trunk of a car.

I’m not a very experienced climber, I’ve just recently sent my first 5.10, but I try to give the kids I belay what advice I can. Yesterday a kid came in and his mother informed me that he had some kind of syndrome, I can’t remember what it was but his left hand was the size of an infant’s. This kid was about 5 years old. He couldn’t really use the left hand so having 3 points of contact on the wall was problematic for him, and I had no idea what to say. I feel bad because he really tried his best and I just didn’t know how to help him. I’ve been running it over in my head and I can’t figure out what I would’ve done differently, but I know that the situation could’ve been handled better because he had been to the gym in the past and had climbed all the way to the top of the same walls that I failed to get him more than 5 ft up.

So the gym I go to has had a lot of price changes. Understandable. They have to make money and the price of everything is going up. However, it's now changed a lot of early doors pricing as well as just the normal pricing structure. I completely understand they can't keep it super cheap for the long run but I don't see how they can justify this price when the centre is about 1/5 the size of the climbing gym one town over who are still super cheap. 

Myself and a friend used to go around 2.30 every week which would mean we could climb for £4.50. Fantastic price. Now, that's changing. The early doors discount is reducing the hours it covers and now the price to climb is £9 for us. I cannot afford that especially as we were going to start to climb twice a week. A months normal gym membership is £15 a month and they expect me to pay £18 a week? Sigh. 

I've been priced out of climbing. I can't afford to do it any more. At all. There's no other decent gym anywhere around here so my choice is to just stop climbing all together. I hate this.

I finally started my new climbing YouTube series ""Hang With Me"".

The filming/editing in this first video is not stellar as it was my first time doing it all (and my first time talking on camera). They will both improve in the following episodes. My plan is to release 1-2 videos per week. One of the videos will likely be a more typical ""projecting with friends"" type video.

I have several questions for you all: Do you find this type of video useful? If not, can you propose changes that would make the content better? I have a group of 5-6 others that will film/climb and access to 4 different gyms. So I will feature comparisons such as small/short, static/dynamic, and flexible/inflexible. Would showing sequences that don't work and explaining why be useful? Is the video too long, too short, or just right? Would you be interested in lead climbing videos if I can use a crane/ledge for up close viewing? Do you have any other comments or suggestions?

4,Dad Gets Knocked Out for 45 seconds while Indoor Bouldering. Happy St. Patty's Day! Hope He's okay.,"I went to a local gym to climb for St. Patty's day. The gym was packed with the usual's and the excited families fresh to climbing.
I was having a pleasant session.
It was all about to change. As I approached a volume/feature problem. From the corner of my eye I saw a man fall about 10 feet away. I didn't think much of it... 
Until I heard a very invasive sound and realized the intensity of the situation and the man's fall. 
My mind went blank and the gym went silent. 

The man had fallen off a v1 slab problem, as he fell his body twisted and he followed his momentum. I saw his face as he hit the wall. It made me cringe, but it took me a few seconds to actually register what had happened.

As usual on a slab climb your foot pops, and all of a sudden you're on the ground. Unfortunately his momentum took him into a spin and causing his back to face the wall. When his feet landed his weight shifted towards the wall, his back hit the pad. All of his weight and momentum whipped his head backwards. The back of his head smacked against the wall with almost all of his weight.
Sadly I was close enough to vividly witness this tragic event, but just far enough that I was out of reach. I mean it happened in a blink of an eye, no one could of reacted in time.

I stood my ground and assessed the situation. the gym went silent I mean this gym is huge, and no one spoke for a good 30 seconds. Most of the gym just stared, I kept a close eye on the man.

I have been CPR certified 3-4 times, currently I'm not certified. But I've been looking into CWI certification through AMGA. I know in this situation, you get someone to go get help, hopefully certified help, and for all of things don't move the person. Especially if they are unconscious, any spinal injury would worsen with any movement.
He was probably out for 45 seconds, his daughter was next to him crying her heart out. I could feel her pain. I wanted to step in maybe I should of more than I did. But as he came to conscious I advised very loudly and clearly to not move him. At this point the man can do whatever he wants, but as a good human I advised over and over not to move him.
Somehow he rolled over to his side, not sure if one of the few people directly next to him moved him or if he rolled over on his own.
I said to not move him again. A staff member had showed up somewhere in the middle of this interaction, he was very calm and supportive, but to my eyes I wasn't sure if he was qualified. I mean maybe I wasn't either, I'm not certified anymore. He checked his eyes and asked him a few questions. Assessed his well being a little bit, and the man said he wanted to stand up. He stood up, he sort of stumbled as he made it to his feet. He awkwardly picked up his jacket off the ground and made his way off the padded area. It was obvious he was concussed. He recorded the event with a staff member before leaving. Which I understand its a liability to the gym to record what happened, but maybe have a family member stay with the employee and record the event so the man can get some real help, its up to the man but if I were him I would have gone to the hospital for a closer checkup. Being knocked out for 45 seconds you shouldn't just walk off, I mean even UFC fighters don't even do that, they get thoroughly checked before they get up and get checked up even more very shortly after.

1. What qualifications does one have when working at a bouldering gym with no roped climbing?
- IMO I have witnessed many situations were it's almost none. Sometimes especially in big cities, a lot of employees have never really experienced outdoor climbing, nor safely climbing in a much vulnerable environment. Even sometimes they can't even climb v4's but they have retail experience! When does safety trump business?

2. The man was wearing very crappy tennis shoes. Should it be mandatory for beginners to wear climbing shoes? Hear me out on this one. I can climb v6+ pretty consistently and when I climb without rock-climbing shoes I feel very vulnerable on v0-v3. And it makes down climbing almost impossible, especially on longer or steeper angled climbs. In the eyes of beginner I understand, I can't climb anything anyways, shoes probably don't matter cause the beginner is so bad. Your thoughts?

3. Spotter? Especially for the beginners. I mean I don't know if the spotter would of helped with this kind of freak accident, him (He probably weighed 175 pounds) twisting his weight falling towards the wall and falling away from any potential spotter.

4. I and another man were key to helping them man after the initial impact of his fall. I actually applied, and interviewed for the job and would of probably been working, because they wanted me to work weekends. They didn't hire me for permanent position, and asked me to work a camp, and bouldering classes, considering I have a lot of experience in teaching outdoor camps with kids. Which I often have to keep the kids safe, and have certain qualifications to take kids surfing climbing etc. This goes back to (1.). When does safety trump retail and customer service experience?

I really hope the man is okay, and sadly this family probably wont be back for climbing anytime soon or ever. What I saw today was one of the glariest falls I have ever seen indoors and or outdoors. TBH I have taken some scary falls, but this was by far the craziest climbing injury I have seen.

Disclaimer. I think the staff of the gym did a great job and they are great people. And they're caring and friendly, but there was just some aspects I would have liked to seen done differently and or better.

That's why when my friends asked me to join them on their trip to a climbing gym, I thought I was crazy when I said yes. I don't think I've made a better decision in my life. 

I decided to start with a simple 5.6 to ease my way into climbing. About 12 feet off the ground, my right leg was shaking uncontrollably and my fear started to get the best of me. The little voice in my head was telling me that it's not too soon to give up  - after all, the higher I go the worse it will be, right? Frozen on the wall, knuckles white from holding on too hard, I was about to go back down when I heard my belayer encourage me to finish, offering me free lunch if I do. With food as my motivation, I slowly but surely ascended the wall. 

When I reached the top, my heart was racing for a different reason: I was indescribably excited, and my love for climbing began (plus rappelling back down Mission: Impossible style made me feel like a complete bad-ass). To this day my heart still races and leg still shakes as I start my climb, but the feeling of conquering my fears when I finish a route is unparalleled.

58,Experiences with ultrasonic treatment?,"I'm currently receiving ultrasonic treatment for shoulder tendonitis, and that combined with kinesio tape seems to be helping my shoulder quite a bit. However I'm only receiving the ultrasonic treatment once or twice a week and ideally my physiotherapist said people should receive it every day for the best and fastest recovery. 

In light of this I have been considering aquiring my own machine, namely the following: http://www.samrecover.com/ (which I would be able to use every day, for up to 4 hours)
But I was wondering whether anyone has any experience with this? or perhaps ultrasonic therapy in general.

I have thus far looked at various research articles and while the paper describing this particular machine claims very good results (no surprise there), the overall consensus in the medical field seems to be that ultrasonic treatment have limited effect, though some recent studies with long exposure machines like the one I'm considering seems favorable, but even then the conclusion in reviews seems to be that more studies are needed to confirm anything definitely.

So I guess my question is, is anyone using this machine? Are you using it purely for injury recovery or also for general recovery between climbing sessions, and if yes how are you using it? (sleeping with it on?, climbing with it on?, or something else?)

Also I realize this might not be the ideal forum to post this in, so if anyone knows of a more ideal forum to ask this in please point me in the right direction :)",climbing,1521282026,alyflex,12,3,True,2018-03-17

If you are new here, visiting, new to climbing, whatever: you need to educate yourself about what areas are closed and follow those closures. A pair of climbers recently were well documented trespassing into an area where a nesting pair of eagles were still choosing a nest. It was clearly closed. It was on federal lands, not local open space. There will be consequences for this stupidity (or selfishness). Pitchforks are ready. Last time this happened the trespasser turned himself in and was given a pass because he was sorry and said he'd help educate others on the closures. This time, maybe the feds won't be so lenient. In any case, the other shoe is going to drop soon.

I just want to underscore: wherever you go, be respectful, follow the rules, etc. You very well can impact access.

2,A Guide to Effective Rehabilitation of Finger Pulley Injuries,"**What I’ve Learned from Finger Injuries: Or how I Learned to Disregard the Gimmicks and Love the Board.**

**Motivation:**
In this post I will detail my journey to understanding finger injuries, testing out various methods and my conclusions on what method works best for rehabilitation.

**Before we get started:**
Stats: Male, 29 years old, climbing for 7 years, height 5’7’’, weight 137 lbs.
YOUR NOT A DOCTOR! 
I am not a doctor or therapist as I have no formal medical training. I simply have my own body and experience, *caveat emptor*.

**First up let’s describe the injury: A2 and A4 pulley sprains/tears**
Over the course of my climbing career I have had my fair share of pulley sprains in different A2 and A4 pulleys in different fingers. On the grading scale these were clearly grades 1 and 2 (minor and major sprain), and I have never had a grade 3 (full tear accompanied by awful pop and complete self-loathing). The process I will describe works for both grades 1 and 2 and I assume will work for grade 3 once you can weight the pulley.

**What are the methods that you have tried?**
In my search to fix my injuries I have tried every popular suggestion (ice bath, contrast bath, rubber bands, putty etc...). While these all help to some degree or another they never provided the clear step-by-step progress to recovery that I was looking for. Should you do them? Yes, if you have the time and patience, I believe that they are all beneficial to some extent. But the majority of your focus should be on the method that I describe below. All the above exercises are supplemental to the method described below. They should not replace it. 

**What Works?**
Hangboarding. Period. Why? It allows for a clear, controlled and most importantly SAFE progression from injury to recovery. Let’s make one thing clear: if you do not actively rehab the injury it will not get better (or at least not at any significant rate). This can be a very disappointing fact to many young climbers with their first injury who believe time off will fix it. It won’t. 

**The Method:**
Get a hangboard (or it could be simply an edge if you have nothing else). You must be able to hang with your feet touching the floor. We will be performing sets of repeaters (weighting the fingers for some interval of time) with 7 seconds on 3 seconds off for 6 reps over one minute. You will then take 3 to 5 minutes of rest depending on how much you need. In all honesty you should not require much rest, because the point of the exercise is to lightly stress the tissues not actually tax them. But that does not mean to not take at least a couple minutes of rest!

**Program:**
Warm-up:
In an ideal world you would be able to do some very light climbing on a wall full of jugs. Think V0/V1 in the gym with absolute control and solely an open hand grip. If you don’t have access to a wall some simple jumping jacks/calisthenics will suffice.

On the hangboard:
Utilize a large jug so that you maintain an open-handed grip. Practice good hang form (activate your back, don’t slouch, try and squeeze an invisible pencil between your shoulder blades). *No stressing of the pulley should occur. You should not “feel” the injury at all during this time.* Even with the warm-up be careful pulling your feet off the floor. Slowly weight the body and pull feet off floor if you feel completely in control, if not simply apply as much load as seems reasonable, remember this is just a warm up.

7 seconds on, 3 seconds off, 6 reps for a total of one minute.
Take 3-5 mins off.
Repeat 3-5 times.

Rehab:
So here is where we actually rehab the injury. We are going to perform the same exact exercise but we are going to utilize a half-crimp grip. The key is to always maintain control, keep good grip posture/finger position, listen to your body and KEEP YOUR FEET ON THE FLOOR! Choose an edge which you can comfortably half-crimp. Set fingers into half-crimp position and SLOWLY weight your fingers just to the point where you can “feel” the injury. We are looking for a slight stress in the pulley, roughly 30% intensity of feeling. A deep, yet light feeling of the injury. Perform the following repeaters focusing on reaching this comfortable “stress point” during the hangs. Go slow, do not rush. We are not getting stronger, we are recovering.

7 seconds on, 3 seconds off, 6 reps for a total of one minute.
Take 3-5 mins off.
Repeat 3-5 times.

Perform this workout 2-3 times per week as the body/schedule/injury allows.

**Progression:**
The progression in this program is that over successive workouts (a couple weeks) you will notice being able to place more and more weight on the injury and it feeling better. The most important factor about this is the psychological boost it gives me (Yes! I am getting better! I can feel the injury getting better! I know what I have to do! I want to keep training!). Typically, you can clearly feel the injury get better over a relatively short period of time (a few sessions). This program has provided me with the quickest rehabilitation of any program I have sought out. Grade 1 can take few weeks and grade 2 can take around 4-8 weeks. If you are a real training nut the best way to perform the exercises is with a scale under your feet. This allows you to exactly dial in the amount of weight that you are putting on your fingers and watch your progression systematically. 


**Prevention:**
(This is just my 2 cents) So now that we have put so much time into rehabbing that nagging pulley strain how do we keep ourselves from getting another one? In my experience the most important factor in avoiding finger injuries is control. Climbing in control. Note this does not mean no dynamic moves. Should you dyno to that huge jug? Sure. Should you dyno to that huge jug off two fingery crimps? Probably not. Should you throw dynamically to some fingery crimp that is above your pay grade? Probably not. If you watch high level/experienced climbers you will see them display precision and control in their movements. You want to emulate this in your climbing style. If you hit that crimp and your elbow bows out, your whole body struggling to maintain position, it is probably not a good idea. 

**Conclusion:**
Conscientious hangboarding provides a measurable, effective and safe paradigm to rehabilitate injured finger pulleys. The exercise allows the user to consistently self-monitor and evaluate the injury from initial trauma back to full strength. I hope that this information will help others on the journey to recovery. Be safe and climb on.

9,I need an attitude adjustment,"I've been climbing seriously for about a year and a half, maybe two years. I love the endeavor particularly for the adventure and the fact that lessons are forced upon you in the act. (That being said, there are many other reasons why I love climbing!) Lately, however, my pursuit of climbing has helped me recognize what I think is a fairly toxic habit of mine, and I was wondering if others here have confronted something similar and how you overcame it.

In a nutshell, I apparently don't have a whole lot of confidence in myself. 

I've thought about this from the perspective of climbing in that I will give this route or that problem a try - I am a strong believer in the ""never try, never know"" mentality. I contrast this against my friends attitudes in themselves as they approach a given route or problem in that they **know they will send.** Two disclaimers here: first, I have seen plenty of my friends get shutdown by a climb; second, most of my climbing friends have been at it for a lot longer than I have and I recognize that they have earned their physical and mental strengths as climbers.

The more I think about my own mental habits as a climber, the more I see a larger pattern in who I am as a person. There are *a lot* of situations I approach in life with a 'I'll give it my best shot' attitude. I think this is usually a healthy attitude, but of course there are exceptions. Attitude is obviously a lot in both climbing and life, and by stepping up to challenging climbs (or just difficult situations in general) already having accepted that I might not/probably won't send, I almost certainly make that a reality. 

I think I am selling myself short because it is way easier to say ""I tried"" than it is to deal with the disappointment of actual failure. I've realized that I often protect myself in this way (as a climber, as a musician, as a romantic partner, etc.), probably as a response to the fact that I am a really harsh critic of myself.

Now that I'm aware of this self-imposed glass ceiling, I want to shatter it. It's weird to me that I am essentially asking for life-coaching advice on r/climbing, but I see climbing as an intensely personal affair that forces these sorts of lessons upon us all. I'm willing to bet that other climbers have dealt with this, and I was really hoping to hear how you've responded.

What can I do to garner authentic confidence in myself, as a climber and as a human?

**TLDR: Climbing has shown me I don't really believe in myself and I want to change that.**

I've read a lot of threads here about recommended La Sportiva shoe sizes, but the thing that is really confusing me is La Sportiva's sizing guide itself. The only thing that I can assert right now is that my toe-to-heel length is 25.4cm. Thats about a 39.5 EU in La Sportiva, but is usually 41 EU for other brands, such as Nike.

Issue is a lot of threads here are saying that shoes like Pythons should be sized down around 2 EU sizes, with people mentioning their EU/US foot sizes. However, I have been unable to determine whether they are talking about normal sizing or La Sportiva sizing.

So if I wear a 39.5EU according to LS, then I should get a 37.5EU for a new Python shoe? Or do I size down from 41EU to get a 39EU Python shoe?",climbing,1520628237,akgoel,23,2,True,2018-03-09

It doesn’t feel like my shoulder itself, more the muscle (or tendon perhaps), but I’m not sure what exactly I injured, how I did it, or what I can do to speed the recovery and prevent it from happening again.

7,Advice for someone building their rack?,"I distinctly remember when I first learned about trad climbing. I thought to myself ""No way in hell I'll ever do that!"" but here I am... Anyway I've been looking at the Wild Country New Friends to complete my single rack. I've only got passive gear so far, but I was wondering what you all thought about choosing the friends to be my cams for an SR. These are some of the questions and concerns I have:
-There are only 6 friend sizes, and they don't cover as small of cracks as the C4s. Do you think that's ok?
-If you don't think that's ok, would getting something smaller (like some X4s) to compliment the friends be a bad move? In other words, would mixing two different types of cams not be a good idea?
-Could I use one set of friends as the only active pro on my rack (in conjunction with a full set of nuts and hexes)?

If you had moderate to severe tendon issues (inflammation, lack of function, fluid build up around the tendon) and took a break to let time do its thing how long did it take? How was it when you went back after?

The longest break I've taken so far is about 5 or 6 weeks, during which time I saw pretty much zero improvement, so I'm a little worried about how long is really needed.

I can always use grips that don't rely on my left thumb in the meantime (no full crimps/pinches), but I was curious as to how important the actual nail itself is, and if I'll be able to resume full hand use before it grows back fully (which should take about 3 weeks to a month)

3,Got my foot behind the rope on a lead fall this weekend and it’s messing with my head.,"I’ve been climbing for about 18 months and leading occasionally for about a year. I’ve started to get really into it in the last 2 months. Both indoor and outdoor.

I was leading a 5.11 in a gym this weekend and took a big fall for a gym.  Slack out for an unstable eyelvel clip, close to the ground, etc. it turned heads.  Problem is that my heal ever so slightly slipped behind the rope. I felt my foot hit the QuickDraw on the way down and my belayer told me he saw it. I got a nice 4” ropeburn on my ankle. I don’t think anyone else noticed because they gym is small and really strict.  I probably would have had my belay cert taken away if they did notice. 

I’m not scared or have lost confidence or anything, just feel like I need to be more careful. I also learned that “behind the rope” means relative to the direction of a potential fall.  Not necessarily just between the rope and the wall. I was to the right of the rope and had my leg wrapped all the way around to the left to access a hold that was behind the rope. If I had stuck my toe in from the left, it would have been fine. 

So my problem is that I feel really embarrassed that I made a mistake. My partner that day, who is an EXTREMELY experienced climber, did the exact same thing minus the fall.  So I feel a little vindicated.  He said it was a bad hold placement and that there really wasn’t a way to use that hold without being sketchy. I still don’t know how ashamed I should be.

57,Issue - Horrible Climber's Elbow,"I've been rock climbing (indoor bouldering) a few times a week for almost 2 months now, and after doing certain routes I started to develop a horrible pain in my LEFT elbow only-- right one has absolutely 0 pain. This makes me think it has something to do with the courses and certain reaches I'm doing. 

At first the pain wasn't so bad, so I ignored it and people told me it would get better and that it was a ""growing pain"" of new rock climbers. After a few more days of climbing the pain got so bad I new I had to stop for awhile, even though I really wanted to just climb (lot of free time as I stayed at my university during spring break). 

I took a break for almost a week, and then went back at it hardcore (yay, they changed all of the routes!). At first it wasnt so bad, but I soon realized that the horrible pain was returning. It got so bad I knew I had to stop. 

Flash forward 2 days later (today). The pain is so unbearable during the mornings right after I wake up and during the middle of the night that it constantly is waking me up. It's an extremely dull, aching pain almost like a massive toothache but in my elbow. I was touching my elbow a bit and determined it's not actually the joint itself but the connecting tissue on both sides of the elbow.

This is horrible. My elbow is killing my right now as I type this (just woke up an hour ago). But later in the day it will subside. 

Does anyone have experience or knowledge about this? All I want to do is climb every day and this is preventing me from doing it.

EXTRE INFO?: I'm fit, 6 ft tall, and 150 lb's.


EDIT: thanks to all the helpful info from you guys, I've determined that what I have is apparently called ""golfer's elbow"" ??? It what hurts is mainly the connective tissue that connects the bony part of the inside of my left elbow to basically my tricep area.",climbing,1520439007,_Resilient_,15,0,True,2018-03-07

Today, tried Miura VS 44 and 44.5. Latter was comfy but obviously ran big. 44 was still giving me a pain due to folded 2nd toe. I read that they expand almost 1 size as you wear them.

I heard that Mythos is relatively comfortable but I felt like they would be a step down after Tenaya Masai.

I read very positive reviews about TC Pro in terms of comfort. However, also read that it is not for bouldering (I mostly do bouldering).
Also, considering katana laces.

However, neither TC Pro nor Katana laces are available in the local stores around me.

Would appreciate if you can share your experiences and suggestions.

Problem is they are so snug around my feet (not painful) that when I take them off my feet are white white and then of course turn red and tingle for the next 15 min.  I'm hoping that as they break in the tightness around the foot will also break in...just enough to let some blood in.

35,Should I Give Up Climbing?,"No, not for forever.  However, ever since I began climbing regularly a little over a year ago I've developed several minor but chronic injuries that in all likelihood would not have developed had I not picked up the sport.  All together these are making me seriously consider dropping climbing for a while.

Here's a list of my issues from most to least recent:

1. Pinched nerve in back (mild, minor numbness/prickling), neck and back spasms
2. Left shoulder, mild bursitis/impingement
3. Mild trigger thumb, left hand
4. Mild wrist strains/weak wrists, left and right
5. Cubital tunnel syndrome, mild, occasional
6. Carpal tunnel syndrome, also mild

Now, I climb 2x a week, and am in the gym 2x a week doing weight training and cardio.  I roll out and stretch everyday.  Absolutely every day.  Frankly I'd say I'm in the best shape of my life.  But even with this the above problems lead me to think that my body mechanics are just not efficient enough for the amount of stress I want to put on my body.  Part of this is because I'm active in ways beside sport - I play an instrument that requires weight bearing and forearm contraction, I'm a pedestrian and do a great deal of walking/carrying loads, and like most of you I know my way around a computer and type a lot.  

In particular, I'm *very* inflexible (even with my stretching routine), and have very tight muscles.  Every PT has encouraged me to address this, and I have made improvements over the years.

None of my injuries interferes with my daily life tasks.  I'm sure that compared to some other climbers they might seem trivial.  However, the pinched nerve in particular worries me - I'm only in my 20s and I'm afraid that with all these problems, if I don't make a real effort to improve my body mechanics I'm setting myself up for some bad problems down the line.

So here are some options as I see them:

1) Quit climbing for the next several months - make r/flexibility my home and stick to a routine, light weight training and cardio, regular massages.

2) Reduce the amount of time climbing to once a week, devote more time to flexibility/cardio.

3) Stop bouldering, only do ropes (bouldering always feels way harder on my body, all of my injuries have come when bouldering), devote more time to flexibility/cardio.

Has anyone had to take a sabbatical like this?  Do you think it's warranted in my case?  How did you fill the time?  Thanks all.

I have been top-roping in unclimbed territory in Colorado the last couple day and have tried several different styles of tree anchors. My favorite is the quickest and most simple. I have been girth hitching two 120cm slings together to extend the length, and then girth hitching the now extended sling around the tree. I have been doing this with a total of 4 slings (2 and 2 with a biner on each extended sling). My question is this: some of the trees are father back from the ledge, is it safe to girth hitch 5 or 6 slings together to increase the length of the anchor to avoid rope drag? Or is girth hitching slings together unsafe for some reason? 

TLDR: can I girth hitch a bunch of slings together to make longer tree anchors for trees that aren’t close to the edge?

57,"PSA: ""You're taller,"" is the biggest gumby thing you can say. It's also a dangerous mindset for life.","Not directed at me as much because I'm 5'10"", but it's said soooo much. So, if you've said it I implore you not to.

Why is it so bad? Three points.

Firstly because it's just not true. In the end height matters little. The vast majority of professional climbers are tiny, especially women.

Secondly you can't fix your height. Way to cop out on trying to self-analyze and identify your problems. You're not actually critically thinking when you say you can't do something as someone else because of height. Your brain is taking the easy way out and blaming something unfixable to make you feel better about yourself.

Thirdly in continuation of the second point it's a super dangerous mindset, and actually makes you a narcissistic asshole. It really does. If you routinely blame something you can't fix for something you can't do then it's because you think that you're already doing well, or ahead of the game, and it's something wrong with someone else for not being you.

TLDR; Don't be a gumby. Climbing is climbing. Being a gumby is a lifestyle. A bad one.",climbing,1520099544,ZackH86,62,0,True,2018-03-03

5,Followup to Chattanooga in mid-Feb,"A while back I posted asking about conditions in Chattanooga in mid February. https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/7o4gya/chattanooga_in_midfeb/

&amp;nbsp;

Well we went so here's a bit of a follow up. 

&amp;nbsp;

First off, the weather was poor for all but one spectacular day. We climbed indoors at TBA and Highpoint, and spent a day traveling to Nashville with a stop at Jack Daniels. That one day, though. Stone Fort is fantastic. So many cool problems and crazy rock formations. We have nothing like that in the North East. 

A bit of advice, if you plan to rent crash pads expect to return them when the clubhouse closes. For us that was 4pm. Luckily we ran into some climbers from home who were nice enough to loan us a pad for the last couple of hours of daylight.

Guys, I was blown away by the level of climbing. Everyone can climb way better than me and way better than most people I know. At TBA the 'slabs' are overhung. Watching children, adolescents, grown ups, and middle age folk send problem after problem was eye opening. People don't seem to climb indoors recreationally. They do it to prepare for the outdoors. And why not? You are surrounded by so many great spots.

You have a fantastic town. Great food (and drink and coffee), nice people. Everyone I interacted with is cool and accepting of climbers. No strange looks, or confused smirks when I tell people I climb on rock and plastic, most of the time without a rope, for fun. No need to explain what bouldering is because the person I'm talking to probably boulders better than me.

All in it was a great trip, even with the weather. Here are some pics.

11,Planning a climbing trip - Need opinion and advice,"Hey guys,

My girlfriend and I are planning a climbing trip in May, for 3 weeks, outside Canada. 

We intent to invest at maximum 2000$ CAD in this trip. Camping is a viable option to save money if need be. 

We are currently seeking advice and opinion because we both feel overwhelmed in the vast quantities of climbing spot around the world. There is so many options and after a few days of Googling we still feel a bit lost in the decision making process. 

Anyway, onward: We are looking at what we could call ""exotic"" destination mostly. At first, Kalymnos seemed like a great idea. But the cost of travel summed with the cost of living seems to break out budget limit. It is really a shame because it looks completely awesome. 

We then looked at Southern Spain, with the world famous Costa Blanca. Again, the cost of travel + renting a car + camping/lodging seems borderline. At there seems to be a lot of time passed driving a car to get to the many and different crags around the area. 

Then, Cuba Climbing. Cheap flight (350$), cheap cost of living... But not much info about the actual climbing! 

Finally, we are even considering going to Utah to explore Moab, Maple Canyon and whatnot. It is exotic in its own sense, where you can nearly believe you landed on Mars. 

We are also looking at a destination where we will be able to do something of our rest days. Something interesting. Beach day, snorkeling, visiting historical spot, hiking, anything really. 

To help you guide us a little bit, here is what we are able to climb:

My girlfriend is currently leading in the 5.10 range. 10+ is too hard for her though. 

For my part, I can send 5.12- in a couple of tries and I feel comfortable leading up to 5.10 in trad. 

With all of that being said, what are other possibilities that we missed? 

What trip did you make and what was your ""coup de coeur""? 

Thanks in advance for all of your tips and suggestions. We will continue to look on our side too but we could really use a hand.

So I have been experimenting with homemade repairs. I have tried a few things from home depot with moderate success. The best being a vinyl/rubber adhesive that is clear and relatively sticky, but isn't particularly tough. I need to re-apply every 6 hours of climbing or so, so about once a week. 

I'm looking at getting shoe goo and trying that. The area I am trying to fix is only on the toe and just last night on the left foot the rubber finally gave way to the leather below. There is no tear in the leather, but it is now partially exposed. I am hoping to fill that hole with Shoe Goo and then build up a little more rubber on top.

12,Responsible for someone decking (no injury though),"Hey, posting this partly to understand what went wrong, partly to hear if anyone has had similar experiences, and partly because I feel incredibly guilty.

I was in the gym belaying a new partner on lead. It had been a few months since I last lead/belayed on lead but I've been doing it on and off for a couple years with a lot of top-roping between. I was using an ATC, and my partner was making their way up a tough segment when they fell. It's hard to say what was going through my mind at that instant. I had my right hand on the brake, but my instinct to grip down on it just didn't kick in—I must have gripped with my left hand distal to the ATC because I got a pretty bad rope burn on it. I feel like I just went blank.

I'm so thankful they were alright (they probably dropped about 30 feet onto a mat and landed well), but I'm distraught with myself at my oversight and inattention. I feel like there were a few elements at play: 1. I just straight up wasn't paying as full attention as I should have been. 2. I failed to instinctively brake with my right hand. 3. It was a new partner, and I didn't exactly know what signs to look out for that they were about to fall and be on my guard for it.

I guess I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts on how I can train myself to not screw up like this again, namely on points 1 and 2 above, though it'll be a while before I feel okay belaying someone on lead. What can I do to make sure my instincts are right? I know it's an inherently dangerous sport, but this was my first real conscious brush with that danger. I'm fully aware that it's only a matter of luck my partner wasn't gravely injured or killed. Should I take this as a sign that I'm just not cut out to be responsible for someone's life in this way?

Foot type: Wideish at the top, tapering to to a fairly narrow heel. Very high arches. 

I've enjoyed the Scarpa instinct VS, although found it to be slightly lacking in hard rubber on the toe. I wore the VS for over a year and loved them, generally.

I could leave the Scarpas on all session, once they were broken in. The Hiangles are a bit too tight, I think I sized them a half size too big.

I started climbing back around august of 2017 and have climbed pretty consistently at least once or twice a week. At one point I was going 3 times a week. Recently I have been having some pain around my right bicep area. I've done some research already and I think alot of people say it's the muscle under the bicep that is causing the pain. I would just like to know for those of you who experienced this, what are some tips to help ease the pain. It only occurs in the right bicep and usually it's after climbing for around 1 hour. The pain feels like throbbing at rest.

Just some things to note in case it helps any: I'm a pretty dynamic climber. I'm am currently doing v4-v5s pretty consistently. Before this pain started I was able to climb for 2-2.5 hours taking turns with a climbing partner and have done several v6s but with the recent pain, i have been having trouble with even some v4s. I used to do some weightlifting but I stopped around the time I started climbing in August and have felt quite a bit weaker than I used to. I think I tend to favor using arms way more than my feet.

The main issue is there are _so_ many discounts for kids and youth climbing classes, yet the gym is not large enough to accommodate this. The employees are subpar and mostly volunteers anyway, so they barely pay attention. I find myself not going as much because of dreading the crowds of wild young’uns. It’s extremely distracting.

The store clerk recommended her wire-locked instead of solid-locked ""because they are safer"" and talked to her about the whiplash effect.

We have been debating about it these few last days and we watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PQcRDrFJyQ) (please excuse the loud music) that depicts it very well.

Seeing the video inmediately provoked a flash memory of the first guy that ever taught me rock climbing years ago explaining the same thing to me. However, I had totally forgotten about this effect as I never had seen it mentioned it again anywhere or experienced it (at least that I realized it).

So, my question is: is the whiplash effect something that comes up pretty often even if we don't realize it and should totally  be accounted for or does it arguably come in play only in a few named situations that should be handled with caution?

I really can't think of a situation, mostly because I'm not experienced enough, I'm sure, and this is why I come to you, guys.

69,Dropped 50 ft by Belayer,"So I was climbing at an indoor gym in Atlanta and I was dropped 50 ft by my belayer while lead climbing. The gym will not release the footage but I was allowed to go in and watch. 
I was at the crux of the problem and my belayer had climbed the route before me and fell on the same move, along with another climber that was with us. I weighted the rope to rest before the move and then let him know I was climbing before resuming. After a few moves I got to it and went for it but slipped. 
In the video you can see he did not have the rope in his hands, was looking down at the ground, and as I fell he looked up at me instead of trying to grab the rope. 

I tried to turn down an ambulance ride but was pretty much told ""Hey you fucking idiot.... you fell 50 ft... you're going"" 

Fast forward
I am lucky to have no bad injuries. Right side of my body is locked up and still in a deal of pain (1 week later) but I am going to make a full recovery. 
The Belayer is being evasive and not responding to any messages I am sending. I told him that since I am dealing with the physical consequences of his actions I expect him to cover the financial parts. He said ""Keep me updated"" and have not heard back since.

Overall, I feel like I've been able to progress to the V5-V6 range within this short time frame due to strength to bodyweight ratio I've attained from BWF, and my mobility/joint durability from a daily yoga practice over the last 5 years.

Been looking to make some extra cash on the side of my regular job, and was considering making a YouTube series of various drills and exercises I believe to be very important and helpful. Obviously they would benefit all of the general public, but I know climbers could relate to them even more.

How do you feel about the market place for this sort of content. Too saturated? Not enough interest? Any and all feedback is a blessing.

28,Beginner climber looking for advice for physical training.,"Hi there climbing reddit! I am here to ask for help with advice on what routines/workouts/meal plans/etc. for pushing past my current physical abilities, as I feel like it is holding my mentality back.

Where to start? I have been climbing in Bellingham, WA's Vital indoor climbing gym for about two and a half months now. The only prior experience that I have had was a one hour session about a year ago when my co-worker took me to this same exact gym.

Let me stress this, I have no prior knowledge of climbing other than the last 2 and a half months of my life.

A little info on Vital. I am not completely sure on how the V-scale rating works, they use colors there.
Green, the easiest, many good holds and straight forward, most beginners won't use all the holds and most will climb straight up.
Yellow, the second, a lot of good holds, we start to see sets that will dig zag up the wall but for the most part is a straight forward climb.
Orange, the third, enough holds to make most sets easy, you don't need technique with these as you can muscle through, although if you use techniques, you can easily fly through most of these routes.
Red, the fourth difficulty, is where things get interesting. You can muscle through some routes but most will force you to learn some intermediate climbing techniques to get past certain cruxes in the routes.
Purple, the second hardest difficulty in the gym. These will stress techniques with a fair amount of physical strength needed to get past certain cruxes.
Blacks, the hardest routes in the gym. I haven't touched many of these but they seem like purples that are heavily demanding on physical strength combined with advanced knowledge of techniques judging by watching people climb them.
There are a select few routes that will overlap, lets say there will be an hard orange that would be easier than a few of the easier reds. I feel like most of these take place between yellows and purples. Greens will for the most part stay greens, and blacks for the most part I feel will stay blacks.

The have a total of 7 sections (I think I counted correctly) and a center boulder.
They have the shorter flat wall, about 15/20ft I would say.
An overhang wall that sits maybe an extra 5 feet that has a steady and constant incline on the way up.
The ""cave"" which has about a 7-10ft. deep pocket (maybe 7/8ft. High) that climbs into a small backwards incline after you make it over the overhang for another 10 or so feet.
A flat wall the has a low starting overhang for the first 3/4ft.
A flat wall that tops out on the center boulder.
A solo wall that is flat for the first 10 ft. Or so and has an mild overhang before the last 5ft.

Lets talk about my progress now.

My first two weeks. Completely clueless. I don't know why chalk is so amazing. I am warming up with greens, projecting yellows, and dipping into oranges here and there. I go there alone, everyday, and spend maybe 2-3 hours working on routes. I meet a few people, but not much, mostly new climbers. Towards the ending of the first two weeks I decide to start using chalk as I heare it gets rid of the moisture in your hands, I feel like I am enjoying myself so I pick up the cheapest pair of shoes that I can find, non aggressive ones obviously. By the ending of these two weeks I have a few oranges that I have been climbing flawlessly and get me used to topping out on the walls and over the fear of being up so high.

Weeks 2-4. Im getting the basics down. I am aware if my body is in the wrong position when im on certain holds and have a decent sense of where I need to adjust to get myself into a position that feels better. Halfway through week 2, I complete my first red, and it's in cave. A huge game changer and confidence booster. My mind starts wandering and is confidently open to trying out and jumping on reds. I feel like this was a snowball effect. My third week I start crushing all the easier/mild reds and still struggle with the the harder ones but it doesn't hurt my confidence, I start pushing myself to finish the harder reds. One particular route is a red, then there is a purple, that uses the same red route, but adds some weird long stretches in the beginning. I decide to project it one day and at the ending of December, I have finished my first purple, although it was on the easier side.

January is interesting. I have started the new year strong. I start meeting and introducing myself to other climbers (everyone is amazing there) there are a few people that I can see myself being compared to so i try and climb sets with them. This month is filled with reds and getting quite a few purples done, halfway into the month, I have done about 3/4 new purples, met tons of people, who have been noticing that I've been there almost everyday. My sessions are longer, average 3/4 hours of straight climbing, long sessions have rest times, in which I watch people climb things I want to climb. Pay attention to the beta, what parts I can and can't use depending on their style. Start piecing together routes the way 2 or 3 different people climb them and adjust certain parts for myself if needed. I start stretching in between attempts for harder routes, before, and after my climbs. By the ending of January, I am more flexible than I have been for the past 10 years, I can feel my arm strength getting better. I start working on crimps and gain a surprising amount of finger strength. I start climbing slope-y/crimpy/pinch routes to gain the strength and feel needed as I notice I have been avoiding certain holds.  I start taking protein towards the ending of January after my climbs. I have no workout aside from strictly climbing.

February is here. The beginning I start noticing that I am neglecting red routes and trying to project mostly purples. I make it a goal to finish all the reds on the concurrent sets at all times, along with two purples. It is going good so far but I feel like even the two easier purples on each wall take a lot out of my physically. I am a slender body type, 5'6"" fairly long arms, average leg length, a little larger than normal hands, larger feet. I have a high metabolism and have been 105/110lb. most of my life. I haven't weighed myself but I can see and feel my upper body and arms gaining a lot of strength. I am guessing I am around 115 currently.

Does anyone have advice on any workout plans I could add into my routine or will climbing alone be enough to take advantage of taking protein? I feel like my mentality is being held back by my physical strength. Or maybe I'm just making excuses for not being able to finish my purple route projects.

I didn't expect this to be so long. :c

29,Safety tips for climbing in areas with no set climbs?,"A while back my wife and I had the unique experience of hiking down from Yosemite Falls when a rockslide happened near camp 4. We decided to check the area out, and found that several huge boulders had fallen -- neat! While we wanted to just hop on and see if we could find some routes, both of us agreed that it probably wasn't the safest thing to do -- one rockslide could easily lead to another soon after, and the rock would definitely not be solid.

At any rate, it got me into wanting to climb in areas without established ""climbs"". If we do go out looking for some of these, are there any important safety preparations we should make apart from the usual considerations when climbing outside? Good tests to ensure a hold is safe before putting full weight on it?

49,Transition from sport to trad,"Hey, been climbing for a bit, know my way around ropes fairly well, though I primarily boulder.

Recently, I've been interested in trad/multi-pitch but honestly, I don't know the best way to go about it.  I've got ropes, draws, slings, lockers, etc.  I'd need some more slings and obviously, cams/nuts.  But, even if I bought cams/nuts, I don't really know how to use them.  I understand the general premise behind them, that isn't hard to understand, but there's a difference between something that will stop you falling and shoving stuff in rocks and having it not fall out.   

I don't really know anyone with trad/multi experience, unfortunately.  And my gym doesn't have any classes on it either.  Which complicates things further.  Could I just do online research and be able to not kill myself, or should I hold off until I can climb with someone who knows what they're doing?  

It is a rather large investment as well, which is also holding me back.  I have been saving for a bit so, I could afford to buy a full rack right out of the gate but, I don't want to spend 1K on gear without any knowledge of how to use it.  

So, how did you get into trad/multi, would you recommend it, what are good resources to look into, and what are some things I need (gear wise) or should know before taking the dive? ",climbing,1519163796,ChucklingKumquat,64,3,True,2018-02-20

21,"Tips for outdoor climbing trip: Cascais area, Portugal","Hi all,

I just started climbing and am practicing a lot indoor. Next month I’ll take an additional course on climbing techniques.

End of April I have scheduled a holiday to Portgual, where I’ll spend my time in the Lisbon/Cascais/Ericeira region. By then I would like to climb there too (outdoors of course). But as I’m new to this sport, I am a bit overwhelmed by all the information on Google, and the little information on TripAdvisor, so I’d love to hear your tips on planning some climbing activity during a holiday abroad.

1. I travel alone. How/where do you find a good climbing buddy/guide? What should I pay attention to when looking for a (local) buddy or guide (any credentials or something)?

2. How do I choose the best routes? I’ve found a few websites (like [Climbing Away](https://climbingaway.fr/en), [Climb Europe](http://www.climb-europe.com/RockClimbingPortugal.htm) and [27Crags](https://27crags.com/countries/portugal)) but just as in point #1, I feel a bit overwhelmed and am having a hard time to see the wood for the trees. 

3. What material and clothing should I bring myself, or is it better to rent stuff over there? (taking into consideration I’ll be there in April on the Atlantic coast side)

4. What camera(s) can I bring during a climb? Does an action camera like GoPro work well with this, or should I opt for a compact camera (I assume bringing an SLR is out of the question)?

5. I’d love to hear your personal experiences/recommendations with climbing in this region!

Thanks a bunch!

36,PSA: PUT OUT YOUR FIRES. The PIT campground in Bishop just burned down.,"Please fresh up on your campfire protocols, especially when visting desert environments. 

[Please adhere to National service/BLM fire guidelines and get a FIRE PERMIT](http://www.preventwildfireca.org/Campfires/)

[From the Inyo National Forest website](https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/inyo/passes-permits/other): 

Campfire Safety: How to Build an Open Campfire Select a level, open location away from heavy fuels such as logs, brush or decaying leaves and needles. Clear an area at least 10 feet in diameter (local regulations may vary). Scrape away grass, leaves or needles down to the mineral soil. Scoop a depression in the center of the cleared area in which to build the fire and put a ring of rocks around it. Cut wood in short lengths, pile within cleared area and light the fire. The fire should be built no larger than necessary. Your fire must never be left unattended and the fire must be extinguished completely before leaving.

While the Fire is Burning: Open Fire Safety Always keep a shovel and bucket of water nearby at all times. While the fire is burning, be sure there is a responsible person in attendance of the fire at all times. Never leave children around a fire unattended.

How to Completely Extinguish an Open Campfire: Use the “drown, stir and feel” method: drown the fire with water, then stir around the fire area with your shovel to wet any remaining embers and ash. Be sure to turn wood and coals over and wet all sides. Move some dirt onto the fire site and mix thoroughly to fully smother it. And finally, feel the area with the back of your hand to ensure nothing is still smoldering.",climbing,1519002248,liangr71,31,154,True,2018-02-18

My question is: is it bad to leave it essentially permanently assembled in this configuration? I haven’t untied it in probably 6months and don’t plan to until I replace the cordalette. A buddy swears it leads to more wear/can be unhealthy for the cordalette but I don’t see how that’s possible. If anything, I’d think the figure 8 limiters would get more ‘welded’ shut over time.

I was at the gym the other day doing pullups on these hanging climbing holds.  3 slots for down to one finger (thumb?).  I've done pullups on them before but this time on my 4th I heard and felt a loud pop below my right ring finger knuckle Deep in the hand maybe 3/4 the way up from the wrist and just inside that fleshy part and on either side of the bone (maybe can fit the head of your thumb in there).  


I did one more, ya know just to see and it seemed fine. I couldn't tell if it was adrenaline or if I really was fine so I stopped.  It didn't hurt terrible, still doesn't.  But my grip is at about 70-80% and there is some swelling and some droning pain/ache but mostly between the pinky and the ring finger and a bit further down the wrist.  Strength seems to be returning but I can't really tell.  X-rays didn't show anything as it's not a bone thing.  So I've been moving it a bit just generally taking care of it as I would an ankle sprain.

I got to the gym and rented all the equipment. ended up not using anything but the shoes lol. I went with a friend and rather than teach me how to belay and him having to belay me, being 270lbs, we decided it was best to just try bouldering, just to see if i even like climbing. Well, i loved it! It hurt like hell, i ripped up my fingers, but it was so fun. I had problems staying on the wall because my fingers arent strong enough to hold my body weight. I got nearly to the top of a V1. Reached for the final hold and missed, and took a fall from basically the top of the wall. I was scared to fall from that high because of my weight, but it didnt hurt at all. After that i projected a couple V2 routes, but i think ill have to get a little stronger and a lot lighter before i can really start to be serious about it.

11,Competitive Climbing - Do I have a shot?,"So, I understand that y'all probably get this question a lot, but I still think I should ask. I'm 18. I love climbing, I've been on the wall since I was three (so fifteen years now), as it was a huge part of my parents lifestyle. However, I never took it very seriously, and it was more a weekend-trip to Indian Creek thing than a regular exercise, so I didn't advance that much. Recently though, I've started to get more dedicated. I was off the wall for almost two years, and very out of shape. When I started back in, I could barely manage v4's. After two months of going to the gym 5-6 times a week (average of maybe 14 hours a week), eating right, and paying attention to my sleep schedule, I'm back to doing hard v8's and onsighting decently hard 12d's. However, I feel like I still have way more to give to the sport, and I know I'm still not anywhere close to my top physical condition.  I'm realizing more and more how important this sport is too me, and I'd like to take it up a notch. I am going to be going to college in the autumn of next year, but as I'm yet out of high school and taking a deferment gap year to work to help pay for an engineering degree, I have the time to take this really seriously.

21,Potential New Climbing Vlog - Thoughts?,"Hi all,

I'm trying with the idea of starting a new climbing vlog based in Boston. I know there are a lot of climbing vlogs already, but my complaint is that they are either for beginners or pros. In my opinion, there is little for intermediate/advanced climbers - and certainly not many vlogs that focus more on learning/teaching than sending. Can you all share your thoughts on if you think this would add to the community?

Why me? Well, I'm a PhD chemical engineer who loves to learn, teach, and improve at climbing. I love physics, especially when applied to my favorite hobby. So the goal would be to apply my understanding of physics to show climbing in the v4-v9 and 5.12- to 5.13 range. I have access to a strong group of climbers who will participate and film, 6 different gyms (tension/moonboarding/cranes for lead climbs/etc), and am obsessed with training. I went from climbing 2 5.12-'s two seasons ago to climbing over 70 new 5.12's and a few 5.13-'s this past season. Simply put, I'm not a pro and I'm not the best climber, but I try hard and think deeply about how to improve.

Ideas for the Vlog: focus on learning and teaching - not just sending. I will show climbs in the aforementioned range with some breakdowns for analysis. I will start from the fingers (looking at over gripping, readjusting, most efficient grips) and cover all aspect of the climbing/climber to the toes (I'm obsessed with footwork, so will pay close attention to this and body positioning/hips). I will talk about training with episodes focused on: developing lock off strength (e.g., locked off one arm lat pulldowns, weighted one arm negatives, static holds, etc); core workouts (novel ones that I believe work for climbing; and hangboarding (I have tons of data to go along with a record of all of the climbs I've done). I can also talk about my warm-up games, compare/contrast different climbers with different sizes/strengths, show different gyms, have videos outside since we go every weekend, and even talk about my last seasons goal of climbing every 5.12 at Rumney (ny successes, failures, and learnings).

In short, I am not the best climber and I do not claim to know everything about training/improving. I take what works and obsessively focus on my weaknesses to improve. I collaborate with a strong group of climbers in the Boston area, so I can't claim that everything I know is my own. I would like to spend time creating a vlog to showcase what I have learned and am learning to intermediate/advanced climbers in an effort to help anyone watching improve/learn about our amazing hobby.

37,Equipment for a Beginner,"Hi guys,

I want to start getting into climbing, and I have a couple questions about equipment. There's a place near me that has an auto-belay system which sounds great for learning. The best value for money option they have is a multi-month membership, as opposed to a package for a certain amount of visits. However, there is no equipment included in the membership. Because I plan on going a bunch, I figured it makes sense to just buy equipment instead of continuously renting. However, I don't have much of a budget and I'm fine with keeping it cheap since I'm just starting.

When looking online, I found this harness: https://www.amazon.com/Climbing-Weanas-Mountaineering-Rescuing-Rappelling/dp/B074FYG7RM/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1518648883&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=climbing+harness&amp;psc=1. The reviews are great, however, one review specifically mentioned that it's not really for use with a belay system. That made me kind of nervous to purchase one on my own and have it end up being essentially useless. I was hoping you guys could recommend a good, cheap harness that can be used with the auto-belay system.

51,Started training power endurance 4 months before the trip – mistake?,"EDIT: I've posted the same question now on r/climbharder after a recommendation here...


I’m a reasonably experienced (10 years) but not great (French grade 6b+ onsight max, that’s about 5.10c I think) climber. Endurance has always been a weakness of mine so this year, in preparation for April/May trips, I started training in January. At the moment I climb 2x/week, as below. I only do routes and try to only focus on overhanging ones. 

- Lead climbing at the wall, 7-9 long overhanging routes. I typically don’t push myself to complete failure, truth be told I will ask my belayer to take rather than fall most of the times… Typical session will be: 5+ warm-up, 6a warm-up, then 4-5 steep routes of close to my max onsight level which is around 6b+; towards the end of a 2hr session I’d be getting pumped, and I’ll switch to either easier steep routes (6a+) or vertical, rather than overhanging. 

- Auto-belay climbing at the wall, 12-15 gently overhanging routes done to failure – I climb until I can’t hold on any longer and my hand opens up on a crimp. I usually do these routes in pairs, with the second being easier. So I’d do 6b+ followed by 6a+, then rest a few minutes, then repeat. Towards the end of the session I’m too tired to maintain that level, and the pairs will end up being 6b followed by 6a, etc. 

What obvious tweaks to my training program would you recommend?

As I understand, this is “sort of” power endurance training, is that right? Shouldn’t I be limiting power endurance to just 4-5 weeks cycles, then switch to some other type of traininig?
It’s mid-Feb, and I want to be ready for trips in early April and May.

The blisters got so bad I had to stop climbing for like 6 months to a year, they would be bleeding every session. It was stupid.

60,Not being allowed to teach rope skills in gym,"I recently started climbing at a new gym, and I noticed one of their rules was that only a trained Coach can teach rope skills. I did not think this was actually going be enforced, untill I was there last night showing a guy basic lead belaying skills. No one was even Climbing we were both on the ground and I was just showing him things you want to keep in mind while feeding rope. A worker comes over and ask us to stop because of the rule above, I was surprised they enforced, but they said they have that rule for liability reasons and we gladly stopped. But, it did not feel right to me, I have never been to a gym that has a rule like that. To me, it seems less of a liability reason and more of a money grab to get you to take their $100 belay course. They still require you to take a belay test, if you take the class or not and I feel like all the liability would come from the test not from being taught. Will probably just take him outside to like a 5.6 route and teach him there.

That was way too much text, but is this a common things in gyms and am I over thinking this or is this a total money grab?

tl;dr My gym will not let me teach my buddy how to lead climb, instead he can only learn from the $100 class

4,Wrist Injury,"Hi guys, 

I was looking for some input on an injury I suffered around 2 1/2 weeks ago. First of all, I will go see a climbing injury specialized physio soon, and am merely looking for fellow climbers that might have had a similar injury, overcame it and might share their potential valuable insights into how to fight it!

The injury occurred in my left wrist when hanging onto a sloper (number 2 I think: https://imgur.com/a/FcjbX ) that hung at a 45 degree angle. The point of the boulder was to move over to the left while having really bad feet and said bad sloper to hang onto only. So my wrist was on the thing, body hanging vertically down, hence there was a 45 degree angle inside my wrist, and then when I moved to the left there was a pain as if one of the ligaments had scrubbed over something.
I felt some pain, but no swelling or anything bad. 1 1/2 weeks later, I started climbing again. It was all great, but in special configurations I would feel sharp pain again, namly: Sidepulling on a volume (open hand again).

Anyways, so 1 week later I was climbing again, and I don't think there was any improve in the situation. I still had 2 occurrences of sharp pain, when loading my wrist wrong. Obviously this happens only in problems that are near my limit and where I really need to load my wrist in sometimes weird angles.
All in all, this injury reminds me of the sharp pain I had long after I twisted my ankle. I could run again, but in certain movements, I got this sharp pain. 
For now, I think I can climb, and train, but I have to be very careful of the position I am putting my wrist in. Obviously this is very limiting and I am very afraid of hurting myself. As a result, dynamic movements are impossible (jumping mostly) because I can't foresee how the load on my wrist will be when sticking the jump. And also during normal climbing, it sometimes unexpectedly happens, obviously. 

So.. anyone have ideas how to mitigate this? How can I deal with it better? 
With the experience of my ankle injury, I know that those kind of direction-sensitive pains might persist for a pretty long time. ",climbing,1518378187,me_is_plant,7,4,True,2018-02-11

Doing a quick search on FaceBook showed me that there is a potential audience of 300,000 people aged 13-40 within a ~70 mile (~110km) radius that have interests in climbing and related terms.

Also, I did some research of my own and discovered that of the 100 largest cities in the US, the average distance to a gym was 14 miles (23km), and the average city had 14 gyms within a 100 mile (160km) radius.

I then went to climb at Joshua Tree for a few days. Everything was relatively fine while climbing.

When I got back, I noticed that something was up with my finger, so I stopped climbing for a month. The issue never went away, I climbed lightly 5.9s and low 5.10s at Smith Rock just before New Years. I then took another month off and just climbed in Tahoe (5.7/5.8 trad) this past weekend, and my finger is still giving me issues! I haven't climbed in the gym for over 2 months, and I use my hands every day for work using tools/machines. So I feel like I am getting adequate blood flow to my fingers.

The problem is now that while I am climbing, it seems a little sensitive, but it works and doesn't hurt. I H-tape it. But then a few hours after climbing my finger is swollen and in pain if I use it at all. Right now it is basically useless as I cannot do much with it.

so my questions are (did google and search on reddit the answers):

* im i just too much of a beginner or did i conclude right that holds should be cleaned from rubber?
* can it be done with a brush or i just need to wait for the gym to take them of and wash them?
* which brush would you recommend as an all around brush? i have a M~~14~~16 type (i think that is the term) but its small and honestly im not to happy with it. Since shipping to my country is usually more expensive then the item itself (a $10 brush is $12 for shipping in general) id like some other recommendation that i could possible find on the internet (maybe some great chinese ripoff brush that is good) or a recommendation what kind of brush to look for at the hardware store. im aware that for quality i need to give out a fair amount of money (and i would if i knew what to buy), but if the item price goes up 2 or more times due to shipping its just to much

10,My climber took a fall,"I have been climbing casually indoors for 7 years. 4 of those were bouldering only. For the last 3 I have been belaying families and parties at my gym for free passes. But a year ago my climber took a fall.

His harness was not tight enough and he did two summersaults in the air before falling out of his harness. He slammed into me, and I dropped my rope. This, I think, haunts me the most. I flew backwards and hit my head on a bench and ended up with a concussion. 

This guy was just celebrating his birthday, and left the gym feeling psychologically scarred. His whole family was dumbfounded. 

I think about the way his body flipped and flopped almost everyday. It was entirely my fault. I should've checked his harness, even though I had reminded them to keep them tight. 

I can't go back to the gym. I have nightmares. I dont think climbing will ever do anything for me but fill me with dread. 

Does anyone else have experience with trauma after a fall? How did you manage feeling responsible? How did you get back in the harness?

Tl;dr my climber didn't have a tight harness, fell, and came out of it. I feel responsible and I have flashbacks all the time. Even though he was fine, I can't climb any more. What do now?",climbing,1518275776,auriandtheunderthing,47,32,True,2018-02-10

I recently implemented a michellin restaurant style rating system(3 stars is worth a trip, 2 stars is worth a detour, 1 stars is worth a stop) but I haven't been to a lot of the locations on the site so I need you guys to help fill in the blanks.

More details on the star system:

3 stars - You're buying a ticket just to go climb there because it's so awesome(ex. Yosemite).

2 stars - Maybe you're climbing at a 3 star spot for a couple weeks already and you want to break up the pace a bit so you take a small side trip to another place. Maybe you're on a business/family trip and want to get some climbing in nearby and are willing to take a bit of a detour(ex. Eldorado Canyon)

1 star - You're going from Point A to B and it isn't too far off your path to get some climbing in at this spot(ex. Shelf Road)

If you've climbed at any of the below let me know how many stars based on the above criteria you think it should be:

* north conway
* roviste
* teverga
* el salto
* quiros
* lake district
* peak district
* north wales
* los dinamos
* pena de bernal
* gaeta
* vinales

18,Morton's Toe problems?,"So I've looking for a new, more aggressive pair of climbing shoes BUT my weirdly shaped feet are making it difficult and they recently decided that they hate me.

Basically I have Morton's Toe which means my second toe is longer than my big toe. It makes sizing a problem as everything besides my big toe curls up into a foot fist. If I wear shoes that allow my toes to remain flat, the long second toe eventually bunches up and my shoes are suddenly too loose by almost a full size.

I've been climbing with Rogues but have been looking at a new pair of Miuras since they're more aggressive but the day after trying on a bunch of shoes my left toes decided to double down on being @$$holes and started swelling and bruising.

Even after going back to my rogues and resting for 10+days my left second toe is a bruised mess. Big reddish purple welts on either side of the toe with a nice blistery-white center in each welt, and the knuckle has puffed up swollen and itchy.

I've ruled out fungal infection annd the dr is calling it corns but it's way worse than any corns if seen. I'm guessing my toes didn't like the more aggressive shoes, but does anyone have any insight? What shoes do you wear to deal with this and how aggressive is your max?

40,Mental game: how do you deal with a fear of heights?,"I am terrified of heights. I also started climbing a few months ago and I love it. These two things are starting to come in conflict.

The thing is, it feels like every other person I've met at the climbing gym is also afraid of heights. It feels like an amazing way to conquer something that's always been a huge fear of mine. I've had multiple people tell me once I get outside indoor walls will feel like nothing, but I haven't felt ready to go outside and don't have anyone to go with yet. I'm also short, and sometimes feel like I have farther to fall than other people, which I know sounds stupid.

I've mostly been bouldering because, let's be real, I am the flaky top rope partner. But the other reason I haven't really been doing top rope is that I am scared. I get about 4-5 feet from the top and I start shaking. This happens with bouldering too. I almost always down climb, but once I get near the top I convince myself that I won't be able to downclimb and I'll fall and hurt myself. This is especially a pain because I DID actually hurt myself from falling during down climbing a few weeks ago. It wasn't severe but I fell wrong (on my side rather than my feet) and my shoulder hurt for a week.

So far, I've been trying to climb routes gradually and getting myself up a little farther each time I try it until I get to the top. I've been practicing falling from higher up so the sudden falls at high heights don't scare me as much. I double check having a mat underneath me and if there's someone I know in the bouldering area a couple of them know how scared of heights I am and will sometimes spot me.

I know I'm not the only climber to deal with this. Does anyone have suggestions? How have you personally dealt with this?",climbing,1518371230,Hropkey,35,14,True,2018-02-11

One of these things was the notion of differentiating a pink point from a red point climb. The difference being that a pink point would be a climb with pre-placed draws while a ""true"" red point would require the climber to place draws. 

The podcasters felt that there should be no distinction but I started thinking maybe there should be. I look at it as if you really want to ""lead"" a climb, from the ground up, you should have to place the draws as well. I mean, if it's really ""all about the movement"" and you're ok with climbing on pre-placed draws, why not climb on a pre-placed rope?

My question is: should the belayer be taking the slack? By taking it in, you're reducing the arc of the whip which can result in some weird ways for climber to hit the wall.


In contrast, if the belayer doesn't take in the slack, the climber takes a slightly bigger whip but comes back into the wall at a more perpendicular angle. An angle that is easier for the climber to catch the whip with their feet.",climbing,1518054151,banana403,18,3,True,2018-02-07

Loüm the giant black obelisk stands before me

No way to go forward but up, up

The mighty wall seems to touch the sky

There’s no way around, or stay and die

No choice left, I must climb the ancient black monolith





 
Climbing, climbing, ever higher

Foothold by small foothold

Careful not to fall from the growing heights

Making haste to escape what lies below
 



Feeling the presence of evil nearing its way toward me

Ascending the titan Loüm is the only path to sanctuary
 





Half-awake, half-dead, exhausted and half-crazed

Has this crossing been hours or has it been days? 

Hungry, tired, in a trance, yet I must push on 

With bloody hands and feet and knees I near the crest of Loüm

66,Your main source of friction lowering with a GriGri,"Introduced someone new to climbing the other night, and they were having trouble smoothly lowering on a GriGri.  I suggested that they try to provide a little more friction with their brake hand and less with the GriGri (ie, closer to an ATC), which is what I tend to do (brake hand locked off at the hip).

Seemed to work for them.

Later in the evening, someone else suggested the opposite - try to meter the cam on the GriGri more accurately, with less friction on the brake hand.

I was curious what others do.  On nice thick gym ropes, do you prefer to control descent speed with the GriGri, your brake hand, or both equally?

I'm currently researching the market potential for a self-spotting crash pad to gauge interest within the climbing community. The idea would be developing a product that allows for crash pads to track climber movement on a boulder and adjust position as necessary. The purposes of this would be to allow for solo bouldering with fewer crash pads, as well as allowing for spotters to focus on things other than re-positioning pads. 

I'd really like as much feedback as possible, without focusing too much on product details this early in the process. i.e., is this something you would be interested in? How much would you be willing to pay for such a product? How much would expect something like this to weigh?

In the start of May i am going on a surfing vacation with some friends. Right now we are leaning towards Portugal.
As There are no outdoor climbing in Denmark where I am from, I try to get my hands on real rock when I am places where it's possible.
I Am  a boulderer, as i like the social aspect of it and I'm afraid of heights..
It would be amazing to try deep water soloing while in Portugal (I am not afraid of heights when it's above water) . Is it safe to do with no guide and no knowledge of the area? And where do you recommend going for surfing and bouldering/deep water soloing?

Climbing level: I have been climbing for 2 years mainly indoor and it's a year since I've been outside. At that time I climbed a handful of 6a+'s, so i guess I am around 6a-6c if it's my style.

Any other beta concerning a trip like this is also warmly welcomed.


Tl;DR: good locations preferably in Portugal with surfing and climbing close to each other.

Have a great day!

It's now gotten bad enough that I have to tape every fingertip and almost had to stop climbing, going once in the last 2 weeks. Even with 2 weeks off it doesnt seem to heal.

I've been thinking about what I could do during this time to minimize my loss. Any idea how I could keep on training, at least the upper body? What do you think about those fingers trainers? Although I don't think myself fit enough for that (climbing less than 2y), I'm considering getting a fingerboard. What would you say?

I initially bought one half a size smaller than my street shoe and they were so excruciatingly painful in both the heel and the toebox that after climbs I immediately had to take them off. My toes were and arches were swelled up like no tomorrow and it also completely tore apart my Achilles. Thinking it could fix the problem, I sized up to my regular street shoe. It was still too tight. I sized up again a whole size and now the shoe is just doesn't feel the same on climbs.

My foot just doesn't work for this shoe. In the first two sizes I got I was experiencing a lot of pain up to the point the performance benefits were useless as I could not stand putting my feet in the shoes. 

I have a very wide toebox and a skinny Achilles that I feel is always going to be in the middle of sizes. Unfortunately I don't have any place near me where I can try on shoes (including my gym) so I have to do trial and error via buying/returning online and the process is very arduous.

31,Forearm pain when releasing grips,"Hello!

I have reoccurring problems with shooting forearm pain (lasting for a few seconds) when releasing the grips as I climb. The pain is on the mid-point between my wrist and elbow on the lateral side of both forearms. I have the same problem when I do pull ups. This might not be an injury exclusive to climbers, but as I experience the problem mostly while climbing, I thought there might be somebody here who can point me in the direction of what to do. Som notes of symptom:

* I only feel the pain when I have a pronated grip. This means a pull up is problematic, but a bicep curl is not.
* I don't feel the pain no matter how hard I squeeze until I actually release pressure.
* I can induce the pain, for example, by squeezing a sponge.
* If I hang with bent arms (as in a mid pull-up movement) the pain will appear when releasing. However, I can release my grip from a dead hang without any symptom what so ever.

I know one should not diagnose injuries over the internet, and this is not a thread I am writing *instead* of seeing a PT or doctor. However, I want to gather as much information I can and see if there are other people who experience a similar problem.

1. Do you think you know what the sound of loose rock is? Try to describe it.

2. Were you taught the skill of banging/knocking on rock to see if its loose? Did it come intuitively? Please comment on this.

3. Could you link me to any sources (videos/articles) teaching people about these skills. 

4. If I was to present you with an audio clip of knocking on rock, do you think you could determine how safe/loose/secure it was? 

5 Any comments on this subject, literally any useful info or opinions on the matter. Please get in touch if you have anything else that will be useful for this subject. (or just to say hi)

Obviously there is a world of different rock types out there and this is simply a very unscientific prod at the subject to get a bit of a feel for what some views might be and how the community reacts these kind of questions.

45,Managing/overcoming fear of heights,"Hello!

My boyfriend and I love bouldering, and he gave me a kind of ""all inclusive"" climbing course for Christmas, where we go and spend in total 12 hours over two weekends at a gym with an instructor who teaches us technique, safety, etc. 

Last Saturday was the first day, and it went okay. I definitely have a fear of heights, which I expressed from the beginning, but it was kind of fine even though I was nervous, as we were just doing top rope. We began lead climbing on the second day, and I panicked still pretty low on the wall. I shed a couple of tears and found it even challenging to watch my boyfriend climb after I crossed the anxiety point of no return. 

I feel really embarrassed about having a mini breakdown in public, but I refuse to give up on trying to overcome my fear of heights, because I love the climbing. Crying in public is embarrassing but worth it if I can get over this. 

So my questions are: 

- Do you have any techniques to avoid/delay the panic while climbing? 
- Is there anything I can do in preparation for next weekend to be able to push myself further? 

Thank you guys so much for your help. Sorry for the blog post!

21,Bump on big toe: 1-year update and related thoughts,"tl;dr: Climbers are understandably super focused on finger and elbow tendon injuries and mostly seem to think that gnarly toes are just par for the course and not anything to worry about. However, sometimes toe injuries caused by tight climbing shoes can actually be a big deal. The good news is, it might be really easy to prevent a lot of toe injuries from ever happening.

**Backstory**

About a year ago, I [posted on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/4za2ed/bump_on_top_of_big_toe_advice/) about a large bump on the joint of my right big toe, exactly where the toe presses against the top of a downturned climbing shoe. I wouldn’t have minded if the bump had just been a weird aesthetic thing, but it was causing me a lot of pain and preventing me from climbing, and it also caused pain outside of climbing, for example when pushing down on the pedals while driving a car.

In the year since I posted, a number of climbers have found my post and PMed me with similar problems to ask me what I did about it. This made me think it was worth posting again with some follow-up.

**Climbing community opinion**

When the bump got big, I asked a lot of climbers about it, and mostly they gave me one of two opinions (which seem kind of mutually contradictory):

-1- Whaa? Weird. Never heard of it.

-2- Don’t worry about it! Climbers all have messed up feet. Be proud of your deformed toes and just keep on sending.

While well-meaning, neither of these reactions was very helpful, especially given that I reached the point where it hurt too much to climb.

**Medical opinion**

I went to two podiatrists and one highly-regarded orthopedic surgeon who specializes in feet. I got two sets of x-rays. The first podiatrist said I had abnormal bone growth in the joint (a bone spur), but when I went to the surgeon she said the x-rays looked normal to her and if there was any excess bone growth it was really minimal. Therefore she didn't think it warranted surgery.

Either way, everyone agreed I had bursitis, which means that the fluid-filled sacs inside the joint started leaking/expanding as a result of trauma. Whether that means cumulative trauma from tight shoes or some kind of sudden trauma from jamming my foot isn’t entirely clear, but the more likely answer was cumulative.

**Things that didn’t work**

-1- Ignoring it

For almost a year after I first noticed the bump, I just kept on climbing and kind of assumed it would go away on its own. For a long time it didn't hurt, it was just aesthetic, so I didn't feel motivated to do anything about it. In retrospect I attribute this to some combination of magical thinking and a vague belief that since I hadn’t heard a lot of climbers mention this particular issue, it couldn’t actually *be* a real issue, and therefore it would probably just disappear if I ignored it. Then it started hurting, and by that point it was too late for an easy fix. I’d like to think I’ve learned a lesson here and won’t do the same thing again in another context, but that might be too optimistic.

-2- Tape

A bunch of experienced climbers suggested taping it. Look, I know climbers use tape for everything. Blow an A2 pulley? Tape it. Torn up finger pads? Tape it. Fall off a highball and impale yourself on a granite spike and you’re bleeding to death in the desert? Just throw some tape on it.

Joking aside, in this case I found that taping was absolutely useless.

-3- Cortisone injection

Extremely painful, not helpful in the slightest.

**How I (mostly) solved it**

-1- Taking a bunch of time off climbing

I know no one wants to hear this one, but I basically stopped climbing for a year, which was how long it took for the bump to go away. The skin over the joint is still red and inflamed ([image](https://i.imgur.com/QobtMGx.jpg)), but it doesn’t protrude anymore, and it mostly isn’t painful unless I really extend the toe. I started climbing again about a month ago, and so far it’s going well.

-2- Switching shoes

I had been using the Miura VS size 41.5 for both bouldering and sport routes (for reference, I typically wear a size 43 for normal street shoes). I really loved the Miura VS, and although they were tight, they were actually reasonably comfortable until this toe issue arose. When I restarted climbing last month, I switched to the Tarantula in 42. Of course I’m hoping to eventually go back to a more aggressive edging shoe given that the Tarantula is terrible on small holds, but it’s worth it to be able to climb again. And if I do go back to a more downturned shoe, it'll be at least a half size bigger than before.

When I first started climbing, I sized shoes based on the heuristic “as tight as possible without causing unreasonable pain”, which is what people recommended to me. I now think that was the wrong approach. If I were starting over based on what I know now, I’d size shoes based on the heuristic “as loose as possible without slipping off on heel hooks”. In reality, that’s only a difference of a half size or maybe one size for most types of shoes, but it could make a big difference for how much one’s feet get damaged over the long term. And then, maybe I’d keep a set of tighter shoes on standby for projecting really hard and meaningful routes.

-3- Silicone toe sleeves

[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MXXXL9G](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MXXXL9G)

The second podiatrist I went to recommended these. They look a little strange, but they’re fantastic! Without these I would not be climbing today. I was concerned they’d be uncomfortably bulky with climbing shoes on, but I don’t even notice them. I’ve been using one on my big toe for about a month and it seems really durable, so I’m guessing one pack will easily last a year. Make sure to buy the ones with a 1-inch diameter.

**Conclusion (possibly crazy)**

Climbers who favor aggressively downturned shoes should consider wearing silicone toe sleeves on their big toes preventively. Of course before seriously recommending this I'd want to see some stats on how many climbers actually get toe joint issues. That said, I’ve already heard that non-painful, purely aesthetic toe injuries are in fact quite common, and climbing is a young sport, so I could easily imagine that a lot of those purely aesthetic injuries may become painful over time. And even if they’re just aesthetic, that’s not entirely meaningless in itself.

Given that these sleeves are very inexpensive and extremely comfortable, to the point where I don’t even notice I’m wearing them, it kind of seems like the rational answer is yes, climbers should wear them on their big toes regularly even before getting injured to cushion against the pressure and friction of tight climbing shoes. After all, lots of other sports have specialized gear to protect against scrapes, cuts, impact, etc., and that gear is often far more onerous than these toe sleeves. This is an incredibly minor step that (maybe) could prevent a lot of toe joint injuries from ever happening.

I know this is a hard sell, because most people never want to take any preventive action no matter how trivial until faced with the overwhelming evidence of their horrible doom, but if I were a climbing coach working with kids, I feel moderately sold that I would suggest they do this (though as I said above, having stats on injury rates would be nice — if people are interested I'll make a survey).

**Conclusion (slightly less crazy)**

Don’t wear the tightest climbing shoes possible year after year just out of macho pride! Save them for projects and/or dangerous routes where you really don't want to slip. When I got into climbing, I thought that the downside when choosing between super tight shoes and more comfortable shoes was just that — comfort — and comfort was something I was okay with sacrificing in favor of performance. What I didn't realize was that actual health was also implicated. I really regret not understanding the full picture when I was making my first shoe decisions five years ago.",climbing,1517556191,nibblesonthebias,59,47,True,2018-02-02

30,Lead rope: your own or your gyms?,"I'm curious to find out what other people are doing for a lead rope in their local gyms. Do you bring your own lead rope, or do you use your gym's lead ropes?

I currently use my gym's lead ropes. I'm thinking about buying my own lead rope to use in the gym. For me it's a safety thing, as I don't entirely trust the gym's lead ropes. They are probably safe, but occasionally I feel the rope is questionable or nearing end-of-life, and I don't want to die just yet (or get seriously hurt).

I'm having trouble justifying the cost of buying my own lead rope when I'm paying a membership fee at the gym that covers lead ropes. I know I could probably get away with a $60-70 30m rope for the gym climbing I'm doing, which isn't much money. But then I start asking myself if I should get a 60m or 70m rope so I can get a better price per meter and have the ability to cut it in half or cut the ends down when it starts to get beat up. That means like $115-130 for the ropes I'm looking at in the 60-70m lengths. Still not breaking the bank, but you know...money is nice to have.

Update: Thanks for the responses. Based on the comments and upvotes, it looks like more people prefer using the gym's lead ropes, although some people prefer to have their own lead rope for peace of mind, cool factor, or to avoid being without one at a busy gym with limited ropes to give out. I decided to order a 70m Beal Karma for a decent price from BackCountry. My gym has limited lead ropes to give out, so having my own fixes that issue, and now I have options for different lengths and cutting it down.",climbing,1517590409,climbingShoeAddict,61,2,True,2018-02-02

48,"""training"" endurance, question on style","In everyone's opinion, as a new climber (6 months, mostly bouldering, top roping for only a month or so now) who can pretty easily climb 5.9's and is just breaking into the 5.10's now that i've gained a bit more endurance.  Is it better for me to do my endurance training by simply climbing as many routes as possible, no matter the grade - so lots of say, going up a 5.8 and down the 5.6 on the same autobelay.  OR, should I try to climb grades that I struggle to climb?

Is it better to simply spend more time on the wall regardless of the difficulty of the route, or should I focus more on routes that are difficult for me?


My typical endurance day is me going in, warming up with a few minutes of traversing, and then climbing between 5.5's and 5.9's until I just can't.  Sometimes i'll down climb if I went up an easier route, but if it's harder and i'm tired at the top, i'll just fall off and rest.  I just broke into the 5.10's (can boulder v3's, just have no endurance) but i'm wondering if my time would be better spent trying routes with harder holds, or if just doing more routes in general will better my endurance.


For sake of judgement, I can pretty much walk up a 5.7, and most of the 5.8's, whether i'm fresh or tired. Sometimes i'll get to the last few moves on a 5.8 when i'm nearing the end of my session, and just fail from being dead tired. 5.9's are also relatively easy - I can zip up them when i'm fresh, but when i'm tired I start to struggle a lot more.  And then 5.10's as i've said, I just climbed my first one, and am projecting another that's got me stuck in a literal corner about 5 moves away from the top.  Obviously it's harder to complete projects on the auto belay since I can't really ""rest"" like I could top rope. But i'm determined to send them.


So, what's everyone's thoughts?  I do moderate weight training as well to prevent imbalance in muscles, and keep my booty lookin fresh (oooo squats), and i'm currently dieting in an effort to lose some more weight (currently 194, would like to be low 180's, was high 230's)  I haven't added any sort of hangboard's into my routine since i'm still relatively new at climbing, but my resolution this year was to climb a v4 on the boulder wall and a 5.11 on the top rope.

15,Is It Okay to Only Boulder?,"Simple question, maybe complicated answer?

I love rock climbing and have been climbing since August of 2016. I am currently bouldering around the V5-V6 range on a good day. There *have* been a few bumps in the road; the main one I can think of right now is straining my fingers too hard when I first started climbing, by full crimping a lot of the time because I just wasn't strong enough to climb the problems I was trying to. Another one was when I developed climber's elbow due to a lack of stretching, which is an issue I still run into every now and then, but that I am able to remedy very effectively by keeping up with stretching and using some trigger point therapy.

I now feel like I have a comfortable climbing schedule and feel pretty good right now, but looking back, I can't help but wonder if I had been doing some lead climbing all this time if I could have avoided some of the issues I have run into. Still, to this day, I have not climbed lead (or sport, or rope, or whatever you call it).

So my question to you guys is, I plan to try lead climbing soon, but say I don't enjoy it as much as just bouldering, would I be okay with only bouldering?

I wanted to let you know that our Climb-on Maps Kickstarter is now live!! This fundraiser will help cover the costs to print our latest map – Joshua Tree National Park.   
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/climbonmaps/joshua-tree-ca-climbers-map    
   
   
We are having killer deals to kick this off – 40% discounts in the first three days! This goes for all of our maps: Smith Rock Oregon, Red Rock Canyon Nevada, and the soon-to-be-published Joshua Tree California.    


We guarantee that you will find these maps useful. High definition trails and symbols packed with information about the difficulties and/or death traverses you’ll find on your approach.    
Even more exciting are the Crag Stats – the circle graphics. These summarize all routes on a crag to show the total number of routes, the grades, and types – a single graphic that summarizes pages and pages of guidebook-text! (or 5 guidebooks in the case of JTree) This makes planning your climbing trip a hundred times easier, and gives you options off the beaten path.   
   
   
If you want to contribute, it is really important to do it on the first days so you can get the biggest discounts, and the campaign can gather momentum.   
    
   
Thanks!!

My question for you is: will this area keep me entertained for the summer? I'm from southern California. I mostly climb trad up to 5.11. I have enjoyed doing ""alpine"" routes in the Sierra up to 5.10. I can do easier snow gulleys, but nothing requiring roped leads. I enjoy long, easy solos/scrambles up to 5.6 or so, depending on the nature of the route. In a day link-ups have always been a favorite of mine. I'd be interested in sport climbing from time to time. Outside of climbing, I enjoy trail running and would like to take up fly fishing. I also like backpacking if the destination is worthwhile or the views along the way are awesome. In the Sierra, I'm comfortable being off trail for many, many miles.  

So tell me, is the area worth spending an entire summer? Will weekday crowds be a problem? Will it be too cold/snowy in June for me to do anything? I'm open to all thoughts and opinions! ",climbing,1517171731,ryans1286,14,3,True,2018-01-28

Until recently I thought that the technique was the same as taught in other countries.

Here in Denmark we're taught to move our hand from the active part of the rope to the breaking part of the rope whenever we want to take in or pay out slack, only giving a dynamic catch by jumping / moving forward.

So recently I found out that the American alpine association and the german alpine association teach it differently.

Both have one hand on the active part as well as one hand on the rope. In the german style they allow the rope in the break hand to slide during a dynamic catch, no moving or jumping. Or so I've been told.

So I took another 3 weeks and iced regularly to promote blood flow... no change at all so I went to local ortho and they said X-ray revealed no fracture so it was certainly a soft tissue injury. She said it was a strained ligament not tendon.  She recommended 3-4 months off any activity that aggravated it.... yesterday was 4 months and while warming up to try and climb just hanging from the 4x4 support beam at the top of my wall, I could feel my hand hurting.   I had a major tendon injury in my left hand about a year and half ago and the doc said 8-10 months before it would heal... it healed in about 3.5 months. The audible “pop” of that tendon was loud enough to be heard on camera. This current injury was nothing like that, it didn’t even hurt until the next day, 12+hrs after climbing. Does anyone have any therapy advice or know of a good sports specific ortho in SC(preferably midlands area)?

If it’s because of physiological differences between men and women, well aren’t there just as many variations within each gender anyway? I haven’t done the research but I’m guessing that there are some men competing who are shorter than some of the women competing for example, or who have a shorter wingspan, etc. We have girl quarterbacks in high school football, women fighting men in MMA (I’m pretty sure this is still pretty rare), maybe it’s time we all just compete together?

6,Free soloing is bad for the sport of climbing.,"I've had mixed feelings about free soloing for a while, but watching Dani Arnold's free solo of Beta Block Super was the last straw. Free solo ice climbs virtually guarantee death at some point no matter how careful the climber. We're basically watching people play Russian roulette. A willingness to subject yourself to danger isn't a skill, and it's not something that should define a good climber. Would a professional motorcycle racer be held in higher esteem if he bucked league standards and started riding all his races without a helmet? What about a football player? It would certainly increase viewership, but only in the way that legalizing blood sports does. The willingness to subject yourself to unnecessary mortal danger isn't a skill. It doesn't demonstrate climbing prowess. It demonstrates steady nerves, arrogance and perhaps a poor understanding of statistics, nothing more. Sure, you could argue that the ability to keep your nerves in check is itself a skill that could be considered a part of the climbing competencies, but should it be? We get to define what makes a good climber. It's not an immutable law of the universe. Do we really want that to be a part of our sport? It's a cruel paradigm. Free soloing offers an attractive, fast, highly entertaining and outlandishly unsafe shortcut to fame. The proliferation of media coverage and amount public attention this stuff gets encourages anyone with aspirations of becoming a famous climber to take extreme, life threatening risks whether they truly want to or not. That's a recipe for a lot of dead climbers. Professional athletes in plenty of other sports have demonstrated their willingness to do reckless things like taking steroids to get an edge on the competition. Of course some pro climbers and high level amateurs are going to do the same and try free soloing even though they don't really want to and perhaps aren't even ready. Why are we encouraging this behavior? Free soloing shouldn't be treated as a legitimate type of climbing. It should be treated as what it is: reckless behavior to be shunned, a dirty trick shot that no respectable climber participates in.

And the last pair I tried was a pair of 5.10 Verdons, with the same issue as the other 5.10s.

My concern is that there might be a shoe that works even better for me than the solutions, but I'm worried about getting something that's worse.

19,Reminder to always think about what could possibly go wrong,"In 2011, I worked as an instructor at an environmental education camp.  One of the high ropes elements was called the “Giant Swing”.  A class or group would pull a rope through a pulley to bring someone high up in the trees (about 50’). The person could then release themselves by pulling on a cord that opens a quick-release shackle, and they went into a free fall swing on the cable.  It was a lot of fun.  Well, one group I had brought a kid up, and when she pulled the release, nothing happened.  Everyone kept trying to explain how to pull it, and folks were getting frustrated while the girl was getting scared.  Eventually, I had the group slowly bring the little girl down.  I inspected the equipment and found that a small length of p-cord got wrapped around the shackle.  I fixed it and had the group bring her back up.  All of a sudden she released and went for a swing.  No one in the group on the ground was ready for that, and they all fell backwards when there was no more weight on the rope.  One of those that fell was a little boy (about 8 or 9) that hit his head pretty hard on a rock.  An ambulance was called as he likely got a minor concussion.  Afterwards, I noticed that the p-cord ripped apart…it’s likely that it was compromised when it got tangled up, and tore when the girl’s weight was put on the system.  I should have thought to check it more closely, it was my fault.  I took the p-cord, and that night I melted it together around my wrist to make a bracelet.  For just shy of 7 years, I wore that cord everyday as a reminder to always be attentive and knowledgeable in whatever I’m doing.   It helped me to think about every possible scenario that could go wrong while rock climbing and ice climbing.  Last night (as I was rough housing with the dog), the cord finally fell off.  It feels so weird to not have it anymore.

31,Quickdraw Order Arrived Dirty. Exchange or Keep?,"So I recently ordered some quickdraws, the Climbing Technology Lime DY set, from Amazon internationally.  They arrived but only one of them was in bubble wrap and the rest were just loose in the box. 

I'm not sure what happened to them but they arrived kinda dirty.  Most of them had this coating of dirt on the rubber keeper but I was able to wipe it off.  One had particularly dark spots on the rubber and on the dyneema dogbone as well. I was able to wipe it all off the rubber, but the dyneema still has a bit of the dirt left, on just one quickdraw.

Things is, I don't really know what it is.  I hope it's shipping truck dirt. But I don't know.  Something must have happened mid-shipping because the box wasn't in great condition, and only one pack of quickdraws was in bubble wrap.


I have two options

1. Get a partial 15% refund. 
2. Return them and they'll send me new ones.


Option 1 would be great if I knew that the quickdraws could be trusted. I have no idea what that black stuff is though, and I feel like I shouldn't be taking a gamble on life saving equipment.  That being said, its probably just a mix of dust and oil from a warehouse floor.

I would be fine with option 2 as well, but that means I have to wait about 2-3 weeks for the new shipment, and I would lose about $20usd in shipping. They'll only refund a partial amount of the shipping to send it back to them.   The quickdraws were a great deal, and this would still keep them a great deal, but I rather not if I don't have to.

33,Core training for a guy with a sore lower back,"Hi, 
I just came back from a half year break from climbing and doing anything sporty basically to being all in on sports.  Just to give you a better perspective I started going to the climbing gym last Saturday from when I went to boulder 2 days in a row, then went swimming one day, had a break for 2 days, went to yoga on Thursday and then 3 straight days of bouldering. I have a great time while I'm climbing but feel like my stretching and exercises after climbing are mess since I'm jumping from one exercise to other with no real goal. 

Now the thing is that I had some small issues with lower back in last year or so. For example when I would try to run (something random without proper warming up like catching a bus or running up the stairs to get faster to the apartment :) I would feel the pain in the lower back and lifting my feet would be a harder task then it should be. Or what happened to me twice in the last year is that when I would try to get up from bed or sth similar sudden back pain would struck me and I couldn't really straighten up myself properly for like a couple of hours. Since it was pretty random I didn't put too much thinking into it because I thought it was all because I wasn't doing that much with my body. I am 25 187cm ~75kg working a sitting job for 8 hours but I really do move around and am aware how much time I'm spending while sitting so I think nothing serious is happening but I have to just start exercising :)

So to make long story short, do you guys have any advice, similar experiences or post climbing workouts I could do so I could strengthen my core to support my back better or is it better for me just to rest for a day or two?

For context, my goal is to be able to get up 5.11s on top rope in the Red by May.

I don't know if this is actually an injury, but yesterday while I was climbing I suddenly heard a pop and my right hand (middle finger) went kinda numb and felt like there was a spring oscillating inside of it. Sort of like when you hit your funny bone but with more oscillation feeling. I immediately popped off the wall and the pain subsided in seconds, and after ten minutes or so I tried going on the wall again, and the same thing happened. Do you guys have any idea what this might be? I'm thinking it might be a partial tear of one of my tendons but I'm not sure.

My gym uses colored tags for each grading in a set of 2. (V0-V1, V2-V3, V4-V5....) I can climb a problem and based on previous experience, place it into a grading based on if it was easier/harder than average for that color. Despite that, I feel I have no understanding of the basis that makes up individual grades. Is the grading simply based on consensus or is there certain moves/techniques/etc that make up each grade?

I.E: In gymnastics, each level has certain skills that it contains and each gymnast must possess them to move to the next level. (I know this analogy is bad but it is the best I can think of)

I don't get too wrapped up into grading, I would just like to understand the thought process that goes into route setting.

40,Increasing Finger Flexibility?,"Hi all,

I recently watched a video from Shauna Coxsey in which she showed a few finger exercises she has been doing to help regain strength in her injured finger.  I’ve seen folks doing similar exercises, but had never had “success” in the past, so I gave it a shot again.

I’m referring explicitly to the exercises where you attempt to keep your knuckles pointed vertically and touch your upper palm (the base of your finger, or right below it) with your fingertips.  I have never been able to get even remotely close, only able to do so with my pinky.  Many people I meet are able to touch their fingertips to the base of their fingers, but I am not capable of doing so.

I’ve been climbing for about 9 years, and have noticed that I also lack flexibility while holding my arm out in front of me straight, palm out, fingers pointed to the ceiling, and pulling back with the other hand.  I can move my hand back about 10-15 degrees before it just won’t budge.  It doesn’t even feel as though I am stretching it, nor with the other exercise I mentioned above.  It just feels like my hand / fingers stop.  They just won’t move any farther without feeling as though I will break my knuckle for the aforementioned exercise (knuckle bending or whatever), and the latter forearm / finger pull back stretch, they just don’t really move, nor will they move farther than they want...  No pain in the pull-back, just no movement.

Does anyone have any tips that they could share for increasing flexibility in your fingers?  Am I just limited in finger mobility?  Hopefully I’m explaining the exercises in a way that makes sense.

9,Why is it easier to grab a hold with the arms slightly bent ?,"My friend says activating the upper arm muscles takes some load off the fingers..   I don't buy it because the body's weight ultimately has to be supported by the fingers regardless of what happens inside the body.

I've read it takes a fraction of a second to activate a muscle, so maybe grabbing a hold with the arms bent gives the muscles time to activate - you can temporarily reduce the load on the fingers by letting the body drop a little.

I could also picture something about the internal mechanics of the arm / hand - how the bones are configured or where the muscles attach, but I haven't yet seen anything specific.

The video is professionally cut and edited film of a professional, sponsored climber. It features a first ascent of a bolted route coming out of a limestone cave/rock house, somewhere in the western United States. Features of the film that stand out in my mind: 

1.) Include a lot of airiel footage from a drone flying across some desolate hills/mountains and into the cave with a lot of red dirt. 

2.) The climbers van, also shot from a drone as it is driving towards the trail leading to the cave in the mountains.

3.) The climber is being belayed by his girlfriend.

4.) I think I remember a tattoo on the climbers side. He was also angry a lot, if I remember correctly. Not yelling like Adam Ondra, but more like the climb gets to him more than it should have maybe.

Or should I just straight up not do any static stretching the day of a climbing session until afterward?

I went a handful of times as a kid but I'm not good at climbing and the last time I went was 10 years ago.  Anyways, we had one of Earth Treks staff belay us for a few runs this weekend and I managed to do one rated a 5.8, which looking at the internet is considered at the low end of intermediate difficulty. I wouldn't say it was easy but it also wasn't terribly difficult. I'm in ok shape but I'm definitely not at an intermediate level rock climber, either physically or skill wise. I'm assuming the reason I was able to pull off the 5.8 is simply because I'm 6'4"" tall and just have a lot more reach that most people. Besides being that tall I also suspect my arms are abnormally long, even for my height because despite every doctor telling me I have extremely tight hamstrings I can still touch my toes easily and can actually put my palms to the floor with a little warm up.

In any case, my question is how do I figure out what an appropriate rating a given trail is for me? Can I just subtract 0.2 or 0.3 or something like that or does it really depend on the type of course and the advantage will disappear on more technical advanced stuff?

46,Block belay on sport route - anchors question,"Hello!

I've searched but can't find an answer to my specific questions, hoping someone to help. Climber UK/f, I've done a reasonable amount of multipitch, but in this case I'll be leading the whole route with a relatively inexperienced second.

1. When setting up an anchor on a multipitch sport route, is it okay to use two slings (minimal slack), one into each bolt with a screwgate/draw? This is the way I have been taught and I am comfortable with this - just checking as I have been looking online and see most set up with one longer sling tied to make a master point. Then pull up rope and set up belay through my belay loop.

2. When my second arrives, they can do the same, one sling in each bolt to make themselves safe? They can then flake the rope over their slings? I understand that I could flake first and then they could flip it, but I feel more comfortable with re-flaking. They then pop me on belay through their belay loop.


I appreciate that there are probably ways that I can make this smoother/easier, but generally I'm just checking that it is safe!!

Many thanks in advance for any advice.",climbing,1516121760,fivebyfive5x5,17,2,True,2018-01-16

8,Tips for climbing around Australia,"I’m in the process of planning a year long trip to Australia (working holiday visa). I would like to spend a significant amount of time rock climbing while I’m there. I mostly like to climb trad and sport (especially mult pitch/adventuring), not really into bouldering much. I hope to spend time in many different areas during the year, though I realize how difficult it is to travel around such a massive country. 

What I already know about (very little): 

* Mt. Arapiles; amazing trad climbing ~4hrs from Melbourne seems like it would be easy to find partners there.  

* Blue Mountains; seems like there is a lot of long awesome multi pitch. 

What I would like to know: 

* Any other must see climbing areas? 

* Any climber camps/communes? I stayed at hangdog camp in NZ and loved it, wondering if Aus has anything similar. 


* General advice?

18,Loud Climber Friend,"Ok, throwing this out there as a WWYD situation. He might read r/climbing (or someone in my local community might and knows us both) and my username isn't really subversive. That would be a bit awkward/amusing, but anyway, here goes!

I have a friend. He's very try-hard yell orientated both indoor/outdoor. Here's the thing though... I'm almost confident it's pure self-aggrandizing at this point.

I'm basing this on we have both bouldered V5+ outdoors like a year and change ago. Last week he was screaming while lead climbing on an indoor semi-stiff for the grade 5.11b. I climbed the route before him, so I kind of knew where the more challenging bits were. He wasn't just yelling on those. It was nearly all the moves at the top. He's always been a bit of a screamer, but this was on a whole new level. The front door staff dude who was/is his friend had to come over and tell him to chill.

He does have mental issues regarding a fear of heights and falling. So I might even be able to chalk the screaming up to self-motivation for moves when things start getting far off the ground as his saving grace, but when the moves of a particular climb are so far below your max... I'm struggling.

I don't think I wan't to climb with him anymore. If his yelling really is mostly self-aggrandizing I'm not even sure if I want to tell him because it's not like it would matter. I'm at a ""you do you, bro"" mindset about it.

46,I've had a pretty severe fear of heights for most of my life and just had the most fun ever,"I feel like the title is a bit over dramatic but I had to share my experience with like minded people. And maybe this could be an encouragement for people with fear of heights.

PS : I like to write so it might be a bit wordy and I apologize in advance.

I have been bouldering in my local gym for a 4 months now. I started when the gym opened up and felt a weird hurge to go try and be out of my comfort zone. My comfort zone was localised between 0 and 3 feet of the ground. Kind of limiting when you think about it. My entire life is paved by stories of a tough looking young man (me with the beard and all) shaking on any type of high furniture and balconies.

So I decided to just try and overpower my fear, plain and simple. I mean, there are these big beafy mat to land on when you f*=^$ up, so what's the problem ?

I was subscribed to the gym after the first session. I was topping out boulder problems 15 feet of the ground after two months. I was just having some damn fun and playing with this sort of tingly and uncomfortable line of fear that I had forever built above the ground. At times the fear felt almost too overwhelming, too primal and raw to ever be overcome by reason alone. But the sheer experience of finally beating any kind of self inflicted limitation is also a very raw and primal in its own rights. Boundaries quickly starting fading away and I finally felt freer than I've ever felt in my short life.

Naturally my brain became a bit addicted to the thought of being even more free. To push and push against the bars of this box that caged me for so long. So today I tried climbing on a rope. And boy, what an experience it was.

See, my fear, even though it resided in some misguided quest for survival, was anything but based on facts or life experience. So even a rope that could, more than in theory, be able to stop me from falling was a terrifying life preserver.

So I went to try and be more with a friend, climbed a couple meters and tried falling. The cord stretches as you sit in your harness and your guts tries to stay in your throat. Gently down you go to the ground. And back at it with the twitchy feeling that you're starting to smile.

This session I went maybe to 35 feet or so. But I went miles beyond what I would have thought possible just a couple month ago.

Climbing has taken me and I'm going with a smile and without looking back.

I am looking to formally recognize the efforts of an employee of mine who saved another climber this past summer (30 Aug 17) at Cochrane Lane in Welsford, New Brunswick, Canada.

An amateur climbing couple from Ontario had tried their hand at a difficult climbing area there when the boyfriend got stuck about 25 m up. The girlfriend sought my employee, who was nearby and is an experienced climber. He assessed the situation, talked the boyfriend through some steps to ensure safety and ascended to help him rappel down. 

Unfortunately, they parted ways without exchanging names or information. In order for me to properly recognize my employee's efforts, I require corroboration of the story, ideally from the couple. 

So my shot in dark is this: does this story ring a bell for anyone? I can't imagine the couple went around telling lots of people about this experience but in the off-chance they did, does anyone here know of a way I can get in touch with them?",climbing,1515510584,Goofguy,16,23,True,2018-01-09

35,5 Tips For Staying Mentally Strong Through A Physical Injury:,"1.	Learn To Listen To Your Body
One of the reasons we get injured in the first place is because we aren’t listening to body’s needs. We spend so much time and energy focused on the end result and performance that we allow ourselves to ignore the signs. This leads to number 2.

2.	Learn To Rest
I know it is talked about a lot in the fitness world but rest is so freaking important and yet so hard to do when we are motivated. The good news is that injuries usually force us to learn to rest and it’s a valuable skill that should be taken seriously. How does my body feel when its begging for rest? How much rest does my body need to feel at its optimal level? Many people never even give themselves enough time to find out what it feels like to be well rested. 

3.	Treat Yo’ Self
You’re injured, and that sucks, but take this time to give your body everything it needs and more. Ice more, sleep more, stretch more, and spend the money on the massage. Your body will thank you and now’s the time to be on its good side. So it can you know…heal and stuff.

4.	Do Spiritual Workouts
The worst news a runner can get is that she can’t run for the next 6 months because she needs knee surgery. Or you can’t lift for 6 weeks because you’ve torn a muscle. It can feel like all of our months and years of hard work just get washed down the drain but that simply isn’t true. You’ve spent lots of time honing your skills and technique and that wont ever be lost. Muscle comes back quickly and the best thing you can do for yourself is the stay positive. That means getting weird with yourself and allowing this time that you would normally be doing weighted pull-ups, burpees, or running a marathon, to work on loving yourself a little more and staying as positive and happy as possible so your body can do its thing and heal as quickly as it can.

5.	Get Coaching, See a Therapist, Read a Self Help Book
When we get injured we spend a lot of time doing physical therapy so that our bodies can learn to heal correctly. But what about our minds? When my physical therapist asks me how I’m doing I usually want to cry and tell her “I’m dying inside because I’m used to running 6 hours a week, climbing every weekend, and doing yoga in my free time to stay sane!” Instead I usually just mumble something like, “oh my knee….it’s getting better”. Unfortunately, most surgeries or injuries don’t come with a mental health plan. Instead, we have to seek it out ourselves but it is seriously so important to our health and healing that it should be like two peas in a pod, physical therapy and mental therapy. I highly recommend spending the money, if you have it, on hiring a coach or a therapist, particularly one who deals with injuries. Or, if you’re low on the moolah, do something as simple as Amazoning a self-help book that will keep your spirits high and your mind focused. You will heal eventually, and while the end result is important, don’t ignore the beautiful process and remember, give your body more love than it can handle.

39,Red Chili - Spirit VCR,"Having recently got into climbing I have reached the point where I can't face renting sweaty shoes from my climbing gym anymore. I've been keeping my eye out for second hand and unwanted pairs to save money. I have found someone with a pair of brand new Red Chili - Spirit VCR that didn't fit. The RRP is around £100 and I can get them for £35.
From a quick google search this is clearly a good deal but I don't want to buy a shoe that isn't suited to my ability.
Having googled them I've seen some reviews claiming they're an all rounder for intermediate to advanced climbers and some reviews claiming they're perfect for beginners.

As I am clearly a beginner I wanted to know will this shoe be suited for me? The information online is contradicting. Will it harm my climbing to get a shoe too technical for my climbs? My primary concern is saving money but I don't want to get something that is clearly unsuited to my level.

Further information that may be relevant - so far I have exclusively bouldered indoors, but I would be interested in outdoor bouldering if the opportunity presents itself.

Thanks for any advice.

43,Interested in bigwall and aid climbing? Check our /r/bigwallclimbing and please help seed it with content!,"If, like me, you've been climbing walls for a while now, and are **mostly** self-taught thanks (in part) to the plethora of resources out there in the deep corners of climbing websites, you know the struggle of actually finding that content.

Generally, those interested in this type of climbing follow the same tracks to particular communities; supertopo, the bigwall sections of MP, andy k's website, etc. And *that* is where a lot of really good, innovative information stays.

Part of me thinks that's great -- you have to *really* want to climb   the big stuff in order to filter through the trash for the gems, and keeping these specialized techniques ""behind the veil"" protects your average newbie from trying something stupid that will get them hurt. The other part of me, however, feels that the more available this information is, the more useful it becomes for those just venturing into the obscure realm of bigwall, and good discussion can actually help increase overall safety.

Enter /r/bigwallclimbing 

The goal is to be an aggregate of those bigwall and aid ""gems"" from throughout the web. Everything from technique-focused posts to things that get you excited for some time on the rock. The ""good"" posts from other sites, the detailed trip reports, detailed discussion of how the waterfall route changed with the latest EC rockfall. All of this in a constructive setting with no political threads, without the ""yer gunna die hur hur,"" and with the reddit format you're used to.

I had immediate pain in my palm and radiating down to my forearm so I stopped climbing and tried to shake it out/keep opening &amp; closing my hand for the rest of the day. Now that I am back home I am trying to pinpoint what might have happened.

* Pointer finger and thumb are fine
* Opening and closing my hand into a fist is painful specifically at the base of my middle finger and into the palm down through the forearm
* However individually bending and pushing/pulling down with my middle finger is NOT painful and does not hurt to the touch
* Individually bending and pushing/pulling down with my ring finger &amp; pinky finger separately are both very painful into my hand and especially down into my forearm. Both of these fingers also feel kind of weak or tired and it is tough to straighten them, but they don't hurt to touch
* No bruising yet, maaaybe a little swelling under my pinky and ring finger but I can't really tell

- When no one in the team has been on the route or has any beta. Will it still be a valid onsight team ascent, if the belayer is coaching and giving beta to the climber from the belay?

- Normally in trad you place the gear on the lead. But if the leader is restarting a pitch due to a fall (to get a red point), one would not clean any gear on the way down for the restart?
As one would normally do for a single pitch trad line.

24,How much difference does weight make?,"I wonder how much difference weight makes to climbing ability.

Say, I am 100 kg (easy number) and I have a body fat percentage of 30% (so 30 kg of fat).

What if I lose 10 kg of fat, making me 90 kg with a fat percentage of 20%.

All other factors being equal (no change in technique, training level, strength, etc), what can this person expect to notice about this change? Just a small 10% difference in climbing ability? Or will it make a seemingly bigger distance?

And what if this person loses another 10 kg of fat (ending up at 80 kg and with a body fat percentage of 10%). Will this change be equal to the first one? Again, the person only loses fat (I know that normally you lose a bit of muscle as well, but I don't want to make this example overly complicated, let's just say this person trains his muscles back to his or her old level right after losing the weight).

I am curious, because (as you may have guessed) I hope to lose some weight and I wonder what I can look forward to. I focus on training my technique in the first place, and in becoming stronger, but weight is just a factor that I know must play a role, I just wonder how big it's role is.

No one else even seems to be interested in hearing any proof of the ascent, it's being taken for granted. The only slightest suspicion I could find was someone in another post commenting ""If this is legit (no reason to doubt it) ..."". Why is there no reason to doubt it?

The credibility of other climbers' ascents in the past has been subjected to question, so why not this one? Am I missing something completely obvious? I really want to believe that she did send the line, so please tell me that there is something to it.

I was wondering if anyone has seen an injury like this before. I've been to hand doctors, had x-ray, MRI, done PT, had surgery, just started another round of therapy. No one had a good idea of the cause of my deformity. 

The tip of my finger is bent. 
I can't really press down with the bottom of my finger pad or else the end of my finger pops up. I don't feel like theres any fiber in my finger to resist/ keep it down.

pics- https://imgur.com/a/yiwXC

The doctors and MRI ruled out mallet finger.

Backstory: I had a hard bouldering session, my finger tips were pretty sore. I should have laid off, but kept climbing ($2k mistake). I landed a dyno with my left hand. As soon as I caught it... that feeling you get when you crack your knuckles, I felt 3 of those in my left middle finger. It felt like something in my finger got re-arranged.

I stopped climbing immediately. A few days later, I went to an orthopedic office who referred me to a hand surgeon. He kind of shrugged it off, and suggested that my tendon were probably just swollen or that I might have a partial tear. 

I did therapy for a month which helped with pain and range of motion, but the bent-ness still remained.

I visited another hand surgeon. He immediately knew something was wrong. After an MRI, he removed my FDS tendon, because it was ruptured and beyond repair.

I'm in the middle of therapy again. My motion is coming back, but I can't help but feel that my initial injury is still present.

I can get 10pcs for about $130. 


So, I'm not sure what to do.  here are options all solids are keylock:

$130 solid/wire mixed 11mm x 17cm dyneema 10pc set

$100 solid straight/bent 16mm x 12cm nylon 10pc set

$130 solid straight/bent 25mm x 12cm nylon 10pc set

$150 solid straight/bent 16mm x 17cm nylon 10pc set

I would prefer the mixed set for what seems safer to me, but I don't know how hard it is to grab on to 11mm dyneema.

If I'm going to do pure solid keylock gates then I guess I'd rather just do 16mm x 12cm since it is so much cheaper.  The solid bottom gate makes me a little nervous because I would want the safest option, also 12cm doesn't seem like that big of a difference.

most of these come in 2 sets of 5 so I could just mix and match if need be.

19,My friend broke their ankle in a lead fall today.,"Not much to the story, but I wanted to clear my head, so I might write a lot. This was the second time I'd met and climbed with my new friend, and the first time we'd climbed outside together. On the climb, she had veered off route a little and then after figuring out the sequence got back on route, and as she was about to clip the draw into the bolt her foot popped and she fell awkwardly, breaking her ankle.

Right before the fall, I was prepared to give slack and had already doled out a foot or two extra, because I knew she'd be reaching for the rope at any second. As soon as her foot popped, I was able to jump back a few feet, but it wasn't enough to stop her from hitting a ledge on the route next to her. The fall was about 10 feet, but she probably hit the ledge about 5 feet down, so a lot of the force was absorbed by her ankle.

She was in intense pain from the get go, and we were both in shock, so there was about 4-5 minutes where I was holding her in place on the wall. I asked her if she wanted me to tie her off so she would stay suspended in place while I got help or at least grabbed my phone to call someone. Eventually though, she gave me the clear to lower her very slowly, which was awkward since she only had the use of one foot, and during the fall had gotten twisted around (so she was facing me - she did not step behind the rope before the fall, I'm sure of that).

On the ground, I  did what assessing I can given my limited medical knowledge and skills. I thought it was a bad idea for her to take off her shoe, but she insisted because the tightness of the shoe was exacerbating the pain, so I held her leg in place as she slowly inched it off. It came off very smoothly actually, like an oversized sock, and her ankle stayed completely steady throughout (this was still a bad call on our part I think).

We had a 15 minute hike down to the parking lot which was awkward because we had two packs and a rope bag, and she couldn't put any weight on the foot. Thankfully some hikers passed by and were heading to the parking lot that ended up being good samaritans. We asked them to help carry our bags so I could carry her on my back.

It took about 30 minutes to get down to the lot, since we were taking our time and I had to take a few breaks and set her down (so much gratitude to the hikers that were patient and carried our packs for us). I was fully committed to taking her to the emergency room, but she wanted me to take her back to her car at my apartment so a friend could pick her and her car up to go to the ER. This delayed her getting to the ER about 30 minutes probably, but this option was just more convenient for her, plus I think she felt like she was inconveniencing me since it was just the 2nd time we'd met.

She messaged me a couple hours later saying she has a talus fracture, which based on my googling is a real doozy.. I know it sucks infinitely more for her than me, but I just feel so terrible about the situation. I know we didn't handle everything perfectly. I feel like in the moment of the fall, I reacted as well as I personally could have and am fine with how I caught her. I've caught plenty of friends that have taken whippers before, so it was an instinctual reaction to the visual cues that she was going to fall. This time just ended up being shittier than all the rest.

I've been planning to take a WFR course soon, so I feel like it's even more important to do that so that I can be better prepared for situations like this.

She handled the whole thing with strength and humor. We both made a lot of jokes on the hike down to the car to lighten the mood. She was already talking about not being able to wait until she's healed so she can go back and finish the climb, which is badass if you ask me. I know it has to be such a let down though. She's a strong climber, that climbs for her school and already had plane tickets for climbing trips bought and this is just a terrible and sudden setback.

The brightside is I feel like I've made a really good new friend, and I expect we'll see each other during the recovery and will hopefully climb again in the future. Plus days like this always make the best stories in retrospect.

30,How much attention should a belayer pay to you?,"The person who was belaying me today (/climbing with me) made some mistakes that I find hard to forgive. Personally, I take belaying very seriously and I have a high standard of myself, because I have someone's life in my hands and there is no excuse for laziness or sloppiness. So, primarily, I make sure that someone is safe. Secondly, I want to enable someone to have a good time when I am belaying. Having a good time myself while belaying is not a priority. When I am belaying, I am a servant of the one who is climbing.

However, this is what he did:

1) When I was at the top, he was watching and talking with someone else. I shouted at him, but he didn't hear me.

2) When I wanted to go down, he kept talking and looking at the other person who was climbing. His head was turned, he could not see me.

3) He let me down a bit, without looking, veeeeery slowly. I was going through mid-air, which was quite awkward. He was holding just one hand on the rope.

4) About halfway he stopped. He was still talking. He had not taken a look at me. I was furious at this point.

5) I snapped my fingers and said HEY! let me down!

6) He played he didn't understand what happened, or (just as likely) he really didn't understand he did something wrong.

Ugh I can't overstate how much I hated that this experience. What made is even worse was that we had a few other (smaller) incidents that made me lose (some) trust in him. For example, when I was done I had to shout at him a lot of times, because he was not looking. From what I got, he watched me less than 50% of the time while I was climbing (and that is a generous estimate).

(Edit: removed a stupid comment on my part about people with a diagnosis that's not relevant for this situation. My apologies for mentioning it)

Now I don't want to climb with him anymore. However, this is difficult, since I am part of a climbing group. This will not make me popular and it will not make him popular, at least, if I tell it. I don't plan to tell him, however. I tried that and he didn't listen. And I don't want to make this too big. Other people should judge for themselves. But I think that I have formed my own judgment. I don't know how I can evade him without telling him, but I need to find a way. At least, that's how I feel.

10 years ago someone nearly dropped me to death in a similar situation. I fell a long distance, stopping only centimeters from the ground. The belayer did not take responsibility. He was also a weird dude.

*What should I do? Am I overreacting?*

It didn't hit me until this morning, actually, but that's the first time I've been able to hang with one arm since I was 10 years old (I'm 28 now). That's it, not a big deal, I know, but I remember being 20ish and just feeling so damn heavy in relation to myself, and didn't realize how much I missed being able to control my own weight.

Really fun sport, can't wait to hit more weird milestones!

TL/DR: Can hang from one arm for the first time since I was 10 (am 28)

Are there any apps you use now? Anything you wish existed? What ""works"" but needs improvement?

26,REI return guilt.,"Good morning friends,
This also feels like a TIFU too.
This all started when I returned a defective pair of Miurra VS's. REI had a pair of 42 geniuses that were returned to the store, so I exchanged them and paid the difference (didn't try them on, I'm compulsive, and I also have a pair of futuras in 42). I got home tried them on and they death gripped my feet, called REI, they sent out a pair of 42.5's. I exchanged them and went to the gym to test them out (i was only going to climb outdoors with them). I bouldered for about 20 minutes and the shoes were like trash bags on my feet, I've never experienced that kinda difference in a half size. At this point I now feel guilty returning them. I've been a coop member for years, never returned anything until this point. Should I feel like a trash bag myself ? 

TL:DR. 
Returning shoes I bouldered in for half an hour. 

Thanks for any feedback and I know this may be excessive.

28,The results of the ape index science fair project! (/xpost bouldering),"Well, [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_iDzFPqyS0EYWjhge41_sR-7xHbQDcKu/view?usp=sharing) is my son's science fair project. I've uploaded the data to a google docs spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_i2PdCxLG2JAORL0PjI1Wso_C5c2kjwA7ihFEGk7gII/edit?usp=sharing), as well. 

Thank you so much to everyone who helped. He went from having 20 observations, spending a half day in the climbing gym nervously approaching people with a tape measure, to 712 observations! (Heck, this is far beyond what even the published studies have used.)

Ben spent hours cleaning the data, standardizing the units and bouldering scales, watching videos about statistics trying to figure out how to do multivariate analysis. In the end, he wasn't really able to figure out how to look at the correlation between ape index and climbing ability while holding the other variables constant. He's 12, just beginning algebra, and it was just too much. Still, he figured out basic trendlines and correlation, and had fun getting better at Excel to make scatterplots of all the data he collected.

Basic results? Each inch of ape index should give you an extra 0.14 points of bouldering ability on the V-scale. The correlation (r-squared) was quite low--0.03, so it only explains 3% of the variation in climbing. Reach was far less important (each inch adds only 0.03 V-points), and height entirely uncorrelated. 

So you can't use being short as an excuse anymore, says Science.

There was also a nice lesson for Ben on sampling and outliers. The respondents were 90% male (reddit, woo!), and the single best climber in the smaller female sample also had the lowest ape index (-5 ape index, V8 climber). That one person reversed the correlation for women.

Anyway, I'm sure there are statisticians or math-savvy climbers here who can make much more of it than we did. There is a wealth of data on climbing and morphology here, and I hope someone can have fun with it. Oh, and if you get published, could you make Ben a coauthor? I'm sure it will look good on his college application...

34,Climbing + Lifting,"I love climbing a lot but recently I've started to work on lifting weights. This is mostly due to being on a seven month military deployment where I can't actively climb. Anyways I'm at the end of the deployment and will be able to climb again soon which I'm super excited but a bit nervous on how much climbing strength I've lost.

I've tried lifting and climbing in the past but after working out hard I'd hit the climbing gym later that day and get really irritated I didn't have the usual strength on the same route I've practiced before. One of the best feelings is struggling on a move and coming back and completely crushing it. Climbing will always be my priority over weightlifting. 

However, since I've started weightlifting I've increased my strength to 165bench/285squat/315deadlift. I've never been strong at weightlifting and I'm finally starting to make some gains which feels great.

So, I suppose I'm looking for some advice to those who climb but move weights around too. 

How is progression on both disciplines?
How do you rest and recover?
Does climbing supplement any workouts?

My current routine is starting strength. A goal I have in mind is at least one rep max of 405 deadlift 315squat 225bench and 1000lbs between the three.

For climbing I have no numeric goals but to just simply get better and do more and more routes. I usually climb 4x a week. I would like to keep it that way too because it's my relief of stress and what I look forward to literally everyday.",climbing,1513801859,Assassin5757,13,2,True,2017-12-20

15,Rappelling with a gri gri.,"I've read a few posts on here about rappelling with an ATC versus a Gri Gri and I'm just curious why the vast majority of people choose the ATC over the Gri Gri when they have both available? 

I'm still far from an expert, but to me rapping with a Gri Gri just seems like such a safer choice. I work at the gym here in my town and the method we use when setting the top rope routes seems like it would work equally as well as lowering from an anchor outside, but have yet to see it mentioned.

this method is:
...Rope is fed through anchor at top of wall as a standard top rope set-up. to set and strip holds on the wall I tie in with a figure 8 follow through like I would when climbing, then I set up the gri gri as if belaying, so I am attach to both ends of the rope essentially. I jug haul up the wall on an easy route and take slack as I go tying  back up knots in the slack end every 5 ft or so in case the Gri Gri's brake fails. I lower from the anchor in reverse fashion untying the back up knots as I come to them.

The part where I'm lowering back down could be the same as rappelling from any anchor on a route could it not? Is it not just doing a double line rappel, like with an ATC, only with less risk?

Am I doing something totally unsafe when I do this?

Why are double line rappel thru an ATC and single line with Gri Gri and the safety knot at the anchor the only methods I've seen here?

Thanks in advance for any advice and/ or explanations for why mine is or is not a safe method.

My accident involved a bad belay and now I irrationally think people aren’t going to catch me. I try to focus on the moves and focus on my breathing and relaxing (you know, all the rock warriors way kind of stuff) but I still say ‘take’ and just am not able to take a whip when I’m in the moment.

47,The fear of leading is starting to make me resent the sport,"I've been climbing for about three years and leading for two.  When I first started leading, I loved it.  It terrified me, but it was thrilling at the same time, and I was progressing quickly.

About a year into it, I took a scary fall at the gym.  I didn't hit the ground, but it was over 20+ feet and I banged my head against the lip of the cave.  Ever since then, I've been terrified of leading.  Uncontrollable shakes, sweaty hands, I've started asking for takes almost every other clip.  It's been so bad that I've started dreading going to the gym.

Lately, I've only been top roping, and I can't even enjoy that because it just doesn't feel the same.  It's almost like I feel some weird shame in not lead climbing anymore and I'm not sure how to get over it.  I want to start leading regularly again (it *sucks* going outdoors and only being a follower) but I can't seem to get over this mental block.

Next day getting dressed was pretty damn painful...if I apply opposing pressure to my thumb (IE taking off socks) I get a shooting pain to the ring finger and pinky. Similarly, I get pains going to my thumb/wrist when certain pressure is applied to the ring finger and pinky, but it's harder to really describe what kind of opposition makes it sting. I don't experience any pain unless I activate my hand in a certain manner, but I can tell that the thumb, piny, and ring finger feel significantly weaker.

 For the last 4 years climbing has been a big part of my life, at least weekly sessions rising to 3 times a week for the past few years. After wallowing at about V6 for most of those two years I finally began to break into higher grades, mostly down to spending too much time on a poor wall. 

Then injury struck. I was taken out of climbing for a couple months with a strain. Got back but was way below what I used to be. Then I fell on a slab about half a year back and have had leg pain ever since. Throughout I was routesetting teaching and rigging outdoors, with people running the show eventually alienated me from. 

In that gap I've tried going back a few times, under the advice of a physio but it just dosn't interest me now. Outdoors I've lost all confidence to lead or boulder and indoors I just feel like I'm struggling and not enjoying. I see pics from here and feel no drive to get back.

44,Do you specialize in a climbing discipline? Ways to break my cycle.,"Listened to Kris Hampton’s latest power company climbing podcast episode and they discussed ways to become a better all-around climber. I found this interesting because they said it’s hard to try not to specialize in a type of climbing, for example: bouldering,  sport climbing, trad, etc (guess you could go so far as to add alpine, ice and mixed climbing). 

Anyways, this is actually something I’ve been struggling with and I’m wondering if anyone else struggles with this too. I want to be an all around climber but I also don’t want to bounce back between disciplines when things get hard. For example, couldn’t do a 5.11 a few months ago so I focused on bouldering. After 3 months of bouldering I couldn’t do a V5 so I went back to sport climbing. Now I can do 5.11 and pushing into 5.12 but I feel like I want to boulder again. 

So, you see, I get in this pattern and have trouble separating myself from trying to specialize to becoming an all-around climber. I’m not saying specializing is bad by any means I just don’t want to limit myself to one type of climbing (even though I subconsciously do sometimes). I also try and justify that I actually have more skill in sport climbing than bouldering but who knows if that’s true. 

Hope this makes sense. Let me know what you people think! Do you enjoy having a speciality or would you like to be an all-around climber? Or is a climber a climber a climber no matter what you climb?

47,advice on finger strength,"
I've been climbing indoors for a couple of months now, going once a week (hoping to increase that soon), and it feels like the one thing that is really holding me back at the moment is finger strength/endurance.

Within about an hour my fingers are so tired that I can't manage even simple routes.

So, a couple of questions...

1) Is there anything I can do to help improve this specific aspect of my climbing? I imagine that 'climbing lots' (and being patient!) is probably the answer, but is there anything else I can do that might help?

2) When I reach that point during a session, is there something else I can do rather than give up and go home? Any other technique that I could work on even when my finger grip is shot?",climbing,1513181069,o-bigode,20,1,True,2017-12-13

29,Unboxing and Initial Impressions of the Wild Country Revo,"I know a lot of people are probably curious how the device works, what the pros and cons are, and how it compares to other assisted braking devices (GriGri, Vergo, etc).

I was not paid to write this up, and I did not get the Revo for free or anything. I paid full price through REI minus the 20% members coupon. If anyone was wondering about ability, I onsight around 5.10c/d outdoor lead and ~5.11 indoor lead. I'm mostly a gym rat, living about a mile from the local spot.

Brief unboxing album here: https://imgur.com/a/Y2bL8

Not to much to see. I was pleasantly surprised at the included storage bag. If you'd like to read the instruction booklet, here's a link to the pdf: http://www.wildcountry.com/revo/Revo_instructions.pdf

On to the good stuff:

First thing I did when I got to the gym with the Revo was find someone willing to take a whip on it. What became immediately apparent to me was that as long as the belayer is paying attention to the climber, with a taught brake strand, the automatic locking will not usually engage at all, since the ""manual"" braking is more than enough to catch even a big lead fall. The automatic brake will only engage if there's enough slack in the brake strand to allow the ""tuber"" component to pop out and lock the rotating wheel.

As a result, it's pretty hard to manually engage the lock when, for example, your climber wants you to take so they can hangdog. I tried a few different techniques but haven't figured out a way to do it yet.

So what does the Revo do well? It pays out slack to a lead climber better than any other assisted braking device, hands down. I would say it feeds even smoother than ATC-style devices as well. It's very, very hard to yank out slack fast enough to cause the device to lock, and if that happens, you can quickly pull down on the brake strand to unlock it.

It also is very safe to use. Unlike a GriGri it will still lock if loaded backwards (climber strand on bottom), and it will actually lock even when only loaded halfway around, which I thought was impressive.

To sum up the pros: super smooth lead belaying, very safe locking functionality, lots of curious people will come ask you what the hell it is (maybe that cute girl you've been hoping to chat up?)

Cons: All or nothing braking that is hard/impossible to manually engage. No assist during lowering, no assist after taking for a climber.

I've seen a lot of questions online, especially on Mountain Project, about whether this device would be suitable for solo rope climbing (Silent Parent replacement). To be perfectly honest I don't feel qualified enough to give a definitive answer to that, but it certainly feels solid enough and locks well enough to do that type of thing.

20,Anyone else have a revo yet? Here's my brief review of it.,"I just got mine this week and am loving it so far!  It's perfect for lead belaying - you can rip slack out and it won't brake.  The fact that there's no way to override the brake is very cool too - I've been dropped on a grigri before by a new belayer who panicked and held the brake release handle up - on the revo, you couldn't drop a climber even if you tried.

The only disadvantages I've found it has compared to the grigri are:

1. Its symmetrical design means the brake also activates if the dead end of the rope is pulled at a speed of above 4 m/s.  When a climber yells take, I've gotten into the habit of ripping that dead end of the rope as quickly as I can to take in slack quickly.  On the revo, this will cause the brake to activate.  I'm finding that with being a little slower / smoother with my takes, this is quickly becoming not much of a problem.  This problem also can cause jump taking to help the climber jug up after a fall being less effective - the brake will quickly activate and deactivate while jump taking, slowing the belayer's momentum and not pulling the climber up as much.

2. I haven't used an ATC to belay with in a long time and have gotten really used to the grigri doing all the work of holding the climber in place during a take.  On the revo, if you are in brake position and the climber rests, you're doing the work of holding the rope in place, like on an ATC.  I'm finding that you can get around this by grabbing the live end of the rope and using your brake hand to push up the tuber, activating the brake and lowering your climber barely a few inches as the brake activates.  It's not a big problem, just an extra step you don't have with the grigri.

TL;DR: It's sweet for lead climbing, I'll probably still use my grigri when belaying someone on top rope though.  If a new climber is belaying me on top rope, I'll probably give them the revo as it's safer to use than the grigri.

Gunna start out by saying I'm reasonably new to climbing and am currently only using gym set ups as opposed to climbing outdoors.

However when it comes to bouldering, I am definitely held back by my mentality. I've been a figure skater for years and am very aware of the damage you can do to your knees if you land wrong. So does anyone know of any guides, or have any tips/videos/anything, that can put my mind at rest whilst I practice jumping from the wall?

18,Review: Tension Flash Board (Portable Hangboard),"I've seen a lot of people on here asking about portable hangboards and after struggling to find some good info myself, I figured I'd post a review and some thoughts.

Video - https://streamable.com/5unfw
Pics - https://imgur.com/a/sfYjI

""So why a portable hangboard?"" I recently took a job in a new city and don't have a climbing gym nearby... now its basically Gold's Gym or no gym. I've been climbing for 10 years, and have always had easy gym / outdoor access... and I've gotta be honest: not having a good local gym sucks.

""Gotcha, hangboard. But why portable?"" Years ago I bought a pair of Metolius Rock rings and quickly swore that I would never buy another hangable training tool.... the rock rings were just way too unstable to use for any kind of difficult hang and are near worthless for training finger strength. So I put together a cheap (free) wall-mounted board above my door using some spare lumber and quickly ran into another problem: it's really really hard to get adequately warmed up to do hard hangs in your bedroom. I thought that I was getting really weak, but in fact I was just never getting warmed up enough to the point where I could do a legitimately hard hang.

So I started looking at no-hang solutions to use at the gym... I felt like doing max hangs inbetween my other sets would be an easy fit, plus it wouldn't feel like such a chore to spend 15-20 minutes warming up since I'm there anyways. However the latest hangboarding episode of the Power Company Podcast kind of turned me off from no-hangs (possible correlation with shoulder injuries?) and so out of desperation I started looking at portable hangboard solutions to use at the gym... after failing to convince gym management to install an actual hangboard.

**Enter the Tension Flash board**. First impressions: the edge depths spot-on and super comfortable. 1/4 pad, 1/3 pad, 1/2 pad, full-pad... everything I need. Plus there is virtually no tipping - the way that the cord is hitched onto the board makes for a surprisingly stable hang, and I feel like I can do legitimately hard hangs with confidence. I was just getting used to how painful the edges on my homemade hangboard were and this thing kind of fucked that all up for me - I'm now remembering just how comfy edges can be.

Conclusion: I'm pretty blown away. Tension obviously put a lot of thought into this thing and it actually works. It's small and light enough that I'd even consider bringing it out to the crag or out bouldering if I knew that I'd be projecting something hard with no warmups nearby. 

At $75 plus shipping, the Flash Board definitely isn't ""cheap"", but given the quality and how well it works, I'm totally satisfied. No excuses for weak fingers anymore!",climbing,1512182584,SoManyBlankets,4,8,True,2017-12-01

1) Any suggestions for specific walls that would be exceptionally suited to us? Areas to avoid? Is the Fruit Wall as good an option as it seems to be?


2) Any killer hikes to suggest in the Red? I've tried to do research but everything I've run across so far seems catered toward the family-with-kids types. Something a little more involved would be cool.

18,Run-outs and R ratings,"Snagged this from a MP thread and I feel the content is so good that it would be a shame not to share. 

QUESTION:

""What's the appeal? Genuine question. I always pass these routes up cause I'd much rather get on a 5.10 crack than some 5.6 no pro slab that I could die on.""

RESPONSE:

""The appeal is to be able to cope with what nature deals out, the good with the bad, as is required when you don't have foreknowledge of the fine details of the climb. This used to be a requirement for entry into the sport, but now has now been reduced to a genre.  It is true that this involves the acceptance of risks that can be avoided by staying away from the unknown and only climbing things that have been predetermined to be appropriately safe.  I can't speak for others, but I think there is considerable satisfaction in deploying the mental and physical strategies demanded by the situation in a way that makes it perhaps exciting yet still safe. 

I think that modern climbing styles emphasize getting up in any fashion over getting up in reversible control.  There's a time and place for both approaches, of course, but the nature of sport and gym climbing means that the reversible control portion of most modern climbers education and practice is not only a tiny fraction of their total involvement, it actually represents a suboptimal approach to succeeding at the kinds of things being attempted.  The result is precisely the situation the OP describes: stress and anxiety in coping with levels of difficulty five grades below the climbers redpoint limit.

In this information-saturated world, we get to finely titrate the types of climbing challenges we want to confront, and there is no reason to get involved in run-out climbing if you don't want to.  Enjoy whatever aspects of the sport you want and avoid the others (but realize that you have to stay on the beaten path to make sure this works).

To the OP,  I'd say take it slow, take it easy, and don't get the idea that you ""should"" be able to climb at some particular grade when things are run-out.  A run-out lead is about far more than the technical difficulty of the moves and can't be thought about in those terms.  If you are interested, stick with trad climbing, and the run-outs will come without having to plan them, and after a while you'll develop good strategies for dealing with them.  Learning to cope can and should take a lot more time than moving through sport-climbing difficulties, where you can try and fail at the crux to your heart's content.  For an example, as someone who learned long before sport-climbing and gym-climbing happened, it took me ten years to climb 5.10, but when I got there I almost never fell off (and of course we didn't hangdog), and I was pretty comfortable on very run-out climbing two grades below that.  At the other end of the scale, whole groups of climbers would go out each Spring and solo up and down a bunch of 5.2's and 5.3's to get back in the swing of things.   There was nothing noteworthy about any of this; almost everyone I knew was doing the same or better.  

Now there are many climbers who can redpoint 5.12 but who would never contemplate unroped up- or down-climbing of a 5.2.  Which is cool, I'm not being critical---these are different times and there are different options available.  But it speaks to what, from an old-timer's perspective, is the asymmetric development of climbing skills that leads a 5.12 climber to approach run-out 5.7 with deep apprehension.

By the way, I think one of the reasons for a decline in run-out climbing ability is the promulgation of protection ratings.  BITD, you just went up and tried things, and backed off if it got too hairy.  We ended up doing quite a few things we'd never have started if the R rating was there to warn us off, while developing a mental framework of being ready for anything.  But we also did a lot of backing off and coming back and backing off again and coming back yet again and perhaps eventually succeeding, although there are some routes I've backed off repeatedly, never did get up, and considering my age-mediated abilities, never will get up.  In all honestly, I see them as a type of success as well, success in caiibrating my abilities to the nature of what was there and correctly assessing the moment to sound a retreat. This was an entire field of endeavor that is only tangentially related to climbing grades, and it doesn't have to be anybody's cup of tea.

The idea that things will come slowly with experience is not a popular thought.  We need books on mental tuning and minutely detailed training regimens to accelerate our progress.  So let me not shirk the contemporary demand for how to speed things up, even if I suspect, at heart, that some things can't be made to go any quicker than nature ineffably intends.  If you want to enhance the ability to climb when run out, then you have to begin by climbing as if you were run out all the time.  It means working out moves and sequences by going up and down to rests or partial rests,  This includes developing the kind of awareness of what you are doing that makes the moves reversible.  (Did you step over a small ceiling from a foothold that is now invisible from above?  Did you make a mental note of rock features that will allow you to locate that foothold from above without being able to see it, or were you laser-focused on the handhold above?) it means sensing when you are past the ""half way"" point and need to devote your remaining energy to get back down to good protection below.  It means failing on well-protected routes you could have done with more aggressive but uncertain and irreversible approaches.  It means if do you fall off, then you failed.  As in failed, not ""I didn't get it clean.""  Perhaps not surprisingly, this is a description of how much of trad climbing used to be practiced, which explains why so many more climbers BITD were completely safe and comfortable, say, downclimbing 5.2's unroped.

It goes without saying that confidence in an ability to climb down out of trouble is important when the protection is poor.  So practice down-climbing the pitches you climb up.  It is far more important to practice down-climbing on real rock than in the gym, because real rock technique depends much more critically on footwork, and footwork going down is not the same as footwork going up.  If the climbs are relatively short, as, say, in the Gunks, then you could also decide that all descents will be done by climbing down something.  No need to be unroped for this, indeed you want to be downclimbing generally well-protected routes much harder than you'd solo down.  So the first person down places gear to protect the ""leader,"" who in this case is the second person down.

As a final note, I think that striving for ""comfort"" on run-out routes is both asking too much and missing the point.  I think the experience involves high anxiety, ruthlessly controlled and extruded into an outer calm that allows for clear thinking and effective movement.

Well, I've blabbed on more than long enough.  I know, TL;DR.  So be it---I ain't providing no summary.""

We don't live far from the local gym but would like to build a wall as a project, and for something to use for short workouts. We don't compete and aren't interested in training for anything in particular. We just enjoy climbing and being together. We're both pretty solidly at the V3/V4 level at our gym, which seems to sandbag a bit compared to others we've been to.

A few years ago, before either of us ever touched a V1, I built [this](https://imgur.com/a/T1vT9): two 4x8's and a 4x4 (that's feet, and sorry for the lighting). I'd like to step it up and am thinking of something with a kickboard and maybe 30^o or 35^o off the vertical, out of 2 or 3 4x8s. Already have a crash pad and will look around for a mattress or two and some carpet. My wife plans to put a wood stove in the garage since we live in a cold area and it's not insulated well.

Does the angle seem reasonable? How would you space the T-nuts? I've never set my own bouldering problems and am spoiled by my local gym's awesome setters; will mine suck? Can I find a way to add a ceiling/cave or is that asking for trouble?

Or should I scrap the idea and just build a MoonBoard? That will be pricey; I already have lots of random holds and would otherwise find some more off Craigslist. Maybe add a volume or two in the future. But if the pool of problems is really worth it I'll consider the MoonBoard.

4,Looking for climbing partner in Red Rocks Dec 2-3,"I'm in Vegas for work this week. Decided to stay over the weekend so that I could hit up Red Rock. Brought my climbing gear including a brand new bi-weave rope. I'd love to get in some multi-pitch trad or sport, but I'm honestly down for whatever.

Sport: Breaking into the 5.12's. Solid 5.11+ climber. Lot's of experience with long sport multi-pitch in Potrero ( time-wave, Sendero Diablo, etc..).
Trad: No experience with trad in Red Rock so I don't know the grading standards, but I've done a decent amount of trad in Squamish and JTree. Happy to follow anything up into the 5.11's, or swing leads up 5.9. I don't have my own trad gear though.

17,Shoulder Injury - Critique My Recovery Routine?,"Hola friends,

So for the past several months I've been dealing with minor, but consistent shoulder pain.  In my case it started after a bout of climbing right after getting a tetanus shot (so stupid of me...), and has continued as a relatively small pain that only happens when I [rotate my arm inward](https://www.expertboxing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/corkscrew-punch.jpg), or try to move it BELOW [this position](https://i2.wp.com/www.orthorehabpt.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/rotator-cuff-physical-therapy.jpg?fit=1151%2C561&amp;ssl=1&amp;resize=350%2C200).  PT thinks that the shot didn't actually cause anything, but instead made an existing problem worse.

I've also had an MRI done, results below:

1. Insertional infraspinatus tendinopathy
2. Mild bursitis

Pain doesn't cause me any problems in ordinary life, but it's been enough to where the PT recommended I stay off the wall for a while.  Thing is, it's been 4 months and the pain is more or less the same, which makes me think it's due to some sort of chronic movement imbalance.  Want to get this handled ASAP, especially since it's so minor and ONLY hurts in the above positions.

Here's the routine I'm sticking to for at least the next month.  **Any suggestions or experiences?  It's frustrating that this has lasted so long, but I'm willing to do the work.**  Thanks.

21,Need some advice to get back on,"A.S: sorry for bad English and for not using some proper words, but I'm Italian

Hi everybody!

I've been climbing since last January, so I'm not a pro. I've started from a 5A (UIAA: V+, Yosemite:5.8/5.9), and after some hard work I'm now on a 6a+ (VI+, 5.10b). Everything was fine, I was really happy with my progress, but then I met a route in my gym I couldn't (can't) solve. The other day I was tryng to close it for like the 20th time, and when I was at three pitons away from the belay, when I slept changing foot. I'd some rope out cause the next move was to get the rope through the quickdraw, my friend who was the belayer was a little distracted, and I made a fall of 5-6 meter, which is not really a lot, but it was my first real fall. I stretched my arm a little cause I tried to stick to the wall, so I didn't continue. Yesterday I decided to get back on, and I was doing fine on another 6a until I'd had to change foot again, and then I felt really scared and anxious, and I had to stop because I barely could move. I want to get through this, so I was thinking to go back a little and start again with easier routes and to try some ""foot-changing"" during boulder, but I'm not really sure. 

Have any of you ever felt like this? (pretty sure yes) What did you do? What's your advice?

31,Sport Climbing in Grampians this Christmas (recommendations?),"Hello r/climbing! I'm going with a mate from the 23 of December to the 1st of January to Grampians, Victoria, Australia. We've got a guide ""Grampians Climbing"" from 2013 from a friend. My first doubt, is if to buy the [newest guide from 2015](http://www.climbinganchors.com.au/grampians-climbing-2015), it states:
&gt; All the usual sport crags have been updated with lots of new routes and updated topos.

And:

&gt; Features action photos by Simon Carter and Neil Monteith and numerous cliff photo topos to make route finding a breeze. In total over 450 photographs. There are also 25 access maps.

Do you think it is a big deal? (Looks like they added a lot of trad stuff, but unfortunately we have no experience/gear for trad).

Our plan after reading a bit the guide (taking into account our level climbing level is up to 23-24 / 5.11c-5.11d / 7a-7a+) is to stay at Stapylton Campground (it has access to quite a few sectors with lots of crags) for the first 5-6 nights. It's also relatively close to Horsham for groceries and so.

And we were thinking on staying in Buandik Campground for the last nights (many crags in the Victoria Range sector, but less than Stapylton). On the last day, on the way back to Sydney driving, we thought on giving a try to the sector Sierra Range or Halls Gap.

Also if we plan to have a resting day (no skin day?) and go visit the south coast to have a swim being in Buandik Campground it's a bit closer apparently.

We don't have a clear idea of how big the distances are in the Grampians or if we'll find a big community of climbers (being hot summer I'm not that sure).

Sooo... Any recommendations/comments will be more than welcome!

36,If there are any photographers in this sub I have a question about climbing photography; specifically about lenses. Looking to purchase my first zoom/telephoto lens and have some questions. More detail in comments.,"I've been shooting climbing as my main focus in photography almost exclusively. I use 3 lenses, all prime at 12mm, 30mm, and 50mm on a sony a6000 (cropped sensor so the focal lengths of the lenses in camera are x1.5).  I've done a lot of photos of bouldering so it hasn't been an issue shooting with prime, and I love the sharpness and low light capabilities.  However, I'm now starting to shoot more on a rope and shooting prime has become a big issue.  I can't zoom so I either have to jug the fixed line, which means i'm missing photo opportunities, or switch my lens, which also means i'm missing opportunity, and its just super sketchy handling my camera gear that high off the ground. 

I'm looking to invest in a zoom lens to fix this problem.  Having never used on before i'm not too sure what would be best.  I'm looking at a 18-105 f4 sony lens, but the reviews are mixed.  What focal lengths would you recommend?  ",climbing,1511796145,CaptainSmathers,20,12,True,2017-11-27

My favorite shoe thus far are the Instinct VS which allow me to edge on tiny nibs and give me power through my toes. 

**Would getting Miuras give me an edge on something the Instinct would not?** I do indoor, planning on outdooring sometime soon as well.

I know views on grading is highly subjective and divisive, but do you reckon we need to start evaluating and assigning new grades to existing climbs as we push the boundaries and limits of our sport? (ie. have the grading system evolve as the sport evolves)

*Edit*

My original thoughts: grades have started losing their meaning; it's not immediately clear ""how hard something is"".

A more ""descriptive"" grading system that can distinguish different climbs of the ""same"" difficulty level (eg. 9b) can be more meaningful to the current and future generations. 

I am *not* disputing the difficulty of these routes nor am I proposing a downgrade/upgrade of others.",climbing,1511456678,bkh_leung,21,29,True,2017-11-23

For the uninitiated, travel hacking is a way to collect rewards points and airline miles quickly and then redeem them to reduce travel expenses (e.g. airfare, lodging, transportation). From what I've been reading, travel hacking makes it possible to drastically reduce airfare costs, oftentimes to $50 or less it seems... I've even read blog posts where people paid less than $10 for a round-trip international ticket.

It's popular among frequent fliers and budget travelers, but I've never heard or read of climbers travel hacking to reduce expenses for big climbing trips -- which is kinda surprising when I think about it. Every climber I know has a list of dream climbing destinations... Spain, Greece, Thailand, Fontainebleau, etc. Travel hacking would make international climbing trips (or any trip that involved flying) so much more affordable.

I know I'm not the first person to think of this. Has anyone here ""travel hacked"" for one of their climbing trips? Or just had any experience with travel hacking in general? What are y'all's thoughts on this?

I understand how to tie the Figure 8 knot and checking the climber and belayer to make sure everything is safe.

My issues seem to be when I am a belayer. I am right hand dominant, so that is my brake hand. I find that I usually switch around my brake hand and guide hand while pulling rope slack through my belay device. So basically, I maintain contact with the rope, but I pull with my right hand, and then switch my guide hand to the rope, instead of putting guide hand on the bottom of the brake hand. I'm curious to know if anyone started out with this type of issue, and how they counteracted it.

When my climber in the class practiced falling, I didnt seem to have any issues as far as catching him.

52,My Gym Prohibits The Use of All Belay Devices Except for ATC and Gri-Gri Because of AMGA Standards?,"Hey All!

I recently bopught my GF a Mammut Smart, an assisted locking tube style device similar to a Megajul.  We both feel more comfortable using this device than an ATC due to its locking capabilites as I am much heavier than she is and she gets somewhat intimidated by catching big falls.  She's never made a belay mistake with an ATC but still, having the locking function gives us both peace of mind.  

Recently at a new gym in my city, we were told that we could not use this device in the gym because the staff are not trained to use it and that only ATCs and Gri-Gris were allowed. I explained how the device worked, that it is at least as safe as a gri-gri (if not safer) and how it made us feel more at ease.  I also told them that several people were using a Megajul in the gym and have not been told to stop, but he said those were not allowed either.  When I pressed further for an explanation, he said that all staff are trained through AMGA and to be consistent, don't allow anything not covered in the AMGA training.

Can someone help me understand why this makes sense?  Is it really not accepted by AMGA standards?  Any advice on getting them to let us use our device?  It's not a huuge deal, but it's very frustrating that the rules of the gym seem to trump actual safety.

A friend and I are visiting Norcal for the Thanksgiving holidays and are looking for a place to do some easy/relaxed sport climbing- probably up to 5.9 or 5.10-.

4,Questions About Anchors and Bolts,"Just climbed outside for the second time ever yesterday at Buck Rock Lookout in Kings Canyon NP. Had an awesome time but the trip raised more questions:  
&amp;nbsp;  
1) One of the top ropes I set up had a 2-bolt anchor sitting on top of the rock. From the anchor bolts to the edge of the rock was approx 2-2.5ft. Is it terrible if our anchor (we used webbing) wasn't long enough to hang off the edge of the rock, hence causing the rope to drag across a bit of rock?  
&amp;nbsp;  
2) I top roped a different route with the intent on leading it afterwards, but upon climbing realized that every single bolt on the way up was loose (the anchor was fine). All of the bolts looked brand new, but I was able to twist/turn the hanger on each of them with my fingers. Some more so than others. This should be 100% avoided, right? Or do people climb on these? Unfortunately I didn't have any tools with me to try tightening them. ",climbing,1510610380,quadcrazyy,16,5,True,2017-11-13
6,Returning climbing needs shoe help,"I climbed a bit maybe 10 years ago, long enough to buy a pair of shoes, and buy a second pair.

I've gotten back into climbing and need to get myself another pair of shoes now. There's (as always) as many answer to this question as there are different shoes, and I'm hoping a kind soul here can point me in the right direction.

1) I'm certain that shoes have changed a lot in the past 10 years. my last pair were Boreal Zens. They did the job.

2) Currently climbing indoors. I enjoy bouldering indoors also (and have a nice little wall in my house as well). Planning to do outdoors stuff also. Looking for something that will do everything to at least an ""OK"" degree.

3) I'm a little heavier and a little weaker than I was 10 years ago, and wasn't the meanest climber in the gym back then either. I tell you this because it's unlikely the the shoes will be the limiting factor here. I'm not one of those guys that sands the paint off my bike to shed a few ounces.

4) The Zens had a really crappy heel cup. Small heels on my feet? Crappy design? Something else? I don't know that answer.

5) Budget in the $150 area, but cheaper would be great also.

6) My feet aren't especially wide.

7) My footwork is decent. I don't need a beginners / rental shoe with an inch of rubber on the toes that's assumed to end up scraped across the walls. I'd prefer something stickier.

8) I still have my Zens but they're just too damn tight now. Did they shrink? Did I grow? Was I just willing to tolerate more pain? Probably all 3. Is minor pain still associated with performance, or have materials, design, and construction mitigated that?

I was looking at a couple that I mostly gleaned from articles that might work for me: the Moccasym, Scarpa's Boostic or Instinct VS, the 5.10 Hiangle, or the Tenaya Tarifa.

Thanks in advance for the help (and for reading all this). I'm hoping for some suggestions, or at least to be pointed in the right direction. And, to be corrected on anything that I'm mistaken about above. I'd buy used also.

53,What if anything does your partner say to encourage you on a hard climb? What do they say that does the opposite?,"On a coaching week our group were discussing the things we say to a climber to help them or encourage them on a difficult sport climb. Since so much of climbing is mental I noticed that personally what people say to me does actually make a difference. Things that help me are:

- Breathe
- You're doing really well (even if it's not true)
- Try really really hard (at the appropriate moment)
- Keep going, I got you (helps when scared to fall)

Things that are nice to hear but don't really help much: 

- Yes, nice one
- Come on

Things that really don't help:

- You got this (if there is still hard climbing to do then I really might want to disagree with you)
- Lots of noise before or during a crux sequence when I need to focus on climbing
- Distracted chatter with others on the ground (if I believe my belayer isn't watching me it suddenly becomes *really* hard to focus on climbing well)

The reason I wrote this post is because on this recent trip I found it really helped me to hear my partner say ""you're doing really well"". If I started a climb nervously I found this really helped me to calm down and worry less about reaching the crux already pumped and just give it a good shot. Also I found a few people agreed that calls of ""you got this"" just worked against them as they are setting high expectations for the next bit of climbing.

My thinking is that if it’s uiaa it’s safe, but I also don’t want to get into a predicament with him climbing this winter where I’m faced with tying a swami mid climb if something goes wrong.

If it has that rating it’s probably safe right?

Edit - I’m also not a brand whore, and really encourage people to cut costs when possible and avoid the mark ups that come with brands. I’m trying to be supportive of his budget and also keep him safe.",climbing,1510766563,Crimpin-aint-easy,37,6,True,2017-11-15
66,Learn the Penberthy knot,"Credit to Larry Penberthy (founder MSR). I've practiced this knot but never used it in anger (yet). I think it's a good one to have in your bag of self rescue tricks, especially for multi-pitch climbers. 

It's advantage is that it can be tied using a cord that is equal diameter to your climbing rope.  Here's an example of using the tails of your rappel lines to ""Prusik"" back up if you don't have slings or cord.  https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/108353040/prussiking-without-any-slings-or-cords",climbing,1510769745,traddad,13,16,True,2017-11-15
